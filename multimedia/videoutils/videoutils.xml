  <title>Video Utilities</title>

  <para>This chapter always seems to be the favorite chapter.  It's
  probably because there is a lot of satisfaction in playing your first
  video when you have spent so much time getting to that point. All those
  libraries, all the configurations and your reward is that you finally get to
  watch a movie. Not to worry though, there is always one more
  CODEC to install.</para>
