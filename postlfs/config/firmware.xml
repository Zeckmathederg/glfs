  <para> On some recent PCs it can be necessary, or desirable, to load firmware
  to make them work at their best. There is a directory, <filename
  class="directory">/lib/firmware</filename>, where the kernel or kernel
  drivers look for firmware images.</para>

  <para>Preparing firmware for multiple different machines, as a distro would
  do, is outside the scope of this book.</para>

  <para>Currently, most firmware can be found at a <userinput>git</userinput>
  repository: <ulink
  url="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/"/>.
  For convenience, the LFS Project has created a mirror, updated daily, where
  these firmware files can be accessed via <userinput>wget</userinput> or a web
  browser at <ulink
  url="&sources-anduin-http;/linux-firmware/"/>.</para>

  <para>To get the firmware, either point a browser to one of the above
  repositories and then download the item(s) which you need, or install
  <userinput>git</userinput> and clone that repository.</para>

  <para>For some other firmware, particularly for Intel microcode and certain
  wifi devices, the needed firmware is not available in the above repository.
  Some of this will be addressed below, but a search of the Internet for needed
  firmware is sometimes necessary.</para>

  <para>Firmware files are conventionally referred to as blobs because you cannot
  determine what they will do. Note that firmware is distributed under various
  different licenses which do not permit disassembly or reverse-engineering.</para>

  <para>Firmware for PCs falls into four categories:</para>

  <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
    <listitem>
      <para>Updates to the CPU to work around errata, usually referred to as
       microcode.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Firmware for video controllers. On x86 machines this seems to only
      apply to ATI devices : Radeons require firmware to be able to use KMS
      (kernel modesetting - the preferred option) as well as for Xorg. For
      earlier radeon chips (before the R600), the firmware is still in the
      kernel.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Firmware updates for wired network ports. Mostly they work even
      without the updates, but one must assume that they will work better with
      the updated firmware.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Firmware for other devices, such as wifi. These devices are not
      required for the PC to boot, but need the firmware before these devices
      can be used.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <note><para>Although not needed to load a firmware blob, the following
  tools may be useful for determining, obtaining, or preparing the needed
  firmware in order to load it into the system:
    <xref linkend="cpio"/>,
    <xref linkend="git"/>,
    <xref linkend="pciutils"/>, and

    <title>Microcode updates for CPUs</title>

    <para>In general, microcode can be loaded by the BIOS or UEFI, and it might
    be updated by upgrading to a newer version of those. On linux, you can also
    load the microcode from the kernel if you are using an AMD family 10h or
    later processor (first introduced late 2007), or an Intel processor from
    1998 and later (Pentium4, Core, etc), if updated microcode has been
    released. These updates only last until the machine is powered off, so they
    need to be applied on every boot.</para>

    <para>Intel provide frequent updates of their microcode. It is not uncommon
    to find a newer version of microcode for an Intel processor even two years
    after its release. New versions of AMD firmware are less common.</para>

    <para>There used to be two ways of loading the microcode, described as 'early'
    and 'late'. Early loading happens before userspace has been started, late
    loading happens after userspace has started. Not surprisingly, early loading
    was preferred, (see e.g. an explanatory comment in a kernel commit noted at
    <ulink url="https://lwn.net/Articles/530346/">x86/microcode: Early load
    microcode </ulink> on LWN.)  Indeed, it is needed to work around one
    particular erratum in early Intel Haswell processors which had TSX enabled.
    (See <ulink
    url="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8376/intel-disables-tsx-instructions-erratum-found-in-haswell-haswelleep-broadwellyi/">
    Intel Disables TSX Instructions: Erratum Found in Haswell, Haswell-E/EP,
    Broadwell-Y</ulink>.) Without this update glibc can do the wrong thing in
    uncommon situations. </para>

    <para>As a result, early loading is now expected, although for the moment
    (4.9 kernels) it is still possible to manually force late loading of
    microcode for testing. You will need to reconfigure your kernel for either
    method. The instructions here will create a kernel
    <filename>.config</filename> to suite early loading, before forcing late
    loading to see if there is any microcode. If there is, the instructions
    then show you how to create an initrd for early loading.</para>

    <para>To confirm what processor(s) you have (if more than one, they will be
    identical) look in /proc/cpuinfo.</para>

    <sect3 id="intel-microcode">
      <title>Intel Microcode for the CPU</title>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Required File</bridgehead>
      <para role='required'>
         <ulink url='&sources-anduin-http;/intel-microcode/intel-microcode2ucode.c'/>
      </para>

      <para>For Intel CPUs an extra program, intel-microcode2ucode, is required. 
      This is done a little differently since it is only a single source
      code file.  The reason for this is that there are different versions
      available, but most are specific to commercial distributions.</para>

      <para>This program reformats the microcode supplied by Intel into a
      format which the kernel can apply. The program
      <userinput>intel-microcode2ucode</userinput> is used to create the
      individual firmware blobs </para>

      <para>Create the program by downloading the source file and running:</para>

<screen><userinput>gcc -g -Wall -O2 -o intel-microcode2ucode intel-microcode2ucode.c</userinput></screen>

      <para>Now install the program as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user:</para>

<screen><userinput>install intel-microcode2ucode /usr/bin</userinput></screen>

     <para>The next step is to get the most recent version of the Intel
     microcode.  This must be done by navigating to 
     <ulink url='https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/26400/Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-File'/>
     and following the instructions there.  As of this writing the most recent
     version of the microcode is <filename>microcode-20161104.tgz</filename>.
     This file is a tar file, but expands to <filename>microcode.dat</filename>
     in the current directory.</para>

     <para>Next, create various blobs with names in the form XX-YY-ZZ in a
     subdirectory named <filename class="directory">intel-ucode/</filename>:
     </para>

<screen><userinput>intel-microcode2ucode microcode.dat</userinput></screen>

     <para>Now you need to determine your processor's identity to see if there
     is any microcode for it. Determine the decimal values of the cpu family,
     model and stepping by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>head -n7 /proc/cpuinfo</userinput></screen>

      <para>Convert the cpu family, model and stepping to pairs of hexadecimal
      digits. For a Haswell i7-4790 (described as Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790
      CPU) the relevant values are cpu family 6, model 60, stepping 3 so in
      this case the required identification is 06-3c-03. A look at the blobs
      will show that there is one for this CPU (although it might
      have already been applied by the BIOS). If there is a blob for your
      system then test if it will be applied by copying it (replace &lt;XX-YY-ZZ&gt;
      by the identifier for your machine) to where the kernel can find it:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv /lib/firmware/intel-ucode
cp -v intel-ucode/&lt;XX-YY-ZZ&gt; /lib/firmware/intel-ucode</userinput></screen>

      <para>Now that the Intel microcode has been prepared, use the following
      options when you configure the kernel to load Intel
      microcode:</para>

<screen><literal>General Setup ---&gt;
  [y] Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support [CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD]
Processor type and features  ---&gt;
  [y] CPU microcode loading support  [CONFIG_MICROCODE]
  [y]      Intel microcode loading support [CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL]</literal></screen>

      <para>After you have successfully booted the new system, force late loading by
      using the command:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/microcode/reload</userinput></screen>

      <para>Then use the following command to see if anything was loaded:</para>

<screen><userinput>dmesg | grep -e 'microcode' -e 'Linux version' -e 'Command line'</userinput></screen>

      <para>This example from the Haswell i7 which was released in Q2 2014 and is
      not affected by the TSX errate shows it has been updated from revision 0x19
      in the BIOS/UEFI to revision 0x20. Unlike in older kernels, the individual
      CPUs are not separately reported:</para>

    <title>Firmware for ATI video chips (R600 and later)</title>

    <para>These instructions do NOT apply to old radeons before the R600
    family. For those, the firmware is in the kernel's <filename
    class='directory'>/lib/firmware/</filename> directory. Nor do they apply if
    you intend to avoid a graphical setup such as Xorg and are content to use
    the default 80x25 display rather than a framebuffer. </para>

    <para> Early radeon devices only needed a single 2K blob of firmware.
    Recent devices need several different blobs, and some of them are much
    bigger. The total size of the radeon firmware directory is over 500K &mdash; on a
    large modern system you can probably spare the space, but it is still
    redundant to install all the unused files each time you build a system.</para>

    <para>A better approach is to install <xref linkend='pciutils'/> and then
    use <userinput>lspci</userinput> to identify which VGA controller is
    installed.</para>

    <para>With that information, check the RadeonFeature page of the Xorg wiki
    for <ulink url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/#index5h2">Decoder
    ring for engineering vs marketing names</ulink> to identify the family (you
    may need to know this for the Xorg driver in BLFS &mdash; Southern Islands and
    Sea Islands use the radeonsi driver) and the specific model.</para>

    <para>Now that you know which controller you are using, consult the
    <ulink url="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Radeon#Firmware">Radeon</ulink> page
    of the Gentoo wiki which has a table listing the required firmware blobs
    for the various chipsets. Note that Southern Islands and Sea Islands chips
    use different firmware for kernel 3.17 and later compared to earlier
    kernels. Identify and download the required blobs then install them:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv /lib/firmware/radeon
cp -v &lt;YOUR_BLOBS&gt; /lib/firmware/radeon</userinput></screen>

    <para>There are actually two ways of installing this firmware. BLFS, in the
    'Kernel Configuration for additional firmware' section part of the <xref
    linkend="xorg-ati-driver"/> section  gives an example of compiling the
    firmware into the kernel - that is slightly faster to load, but uses more
    kernel memory. Here we will use the alternative method of making the radeon
    driver a module. In your kernel config set the following: </para>

<screen><literal>Device Drivers ---&gt;
  Graphics support ---&gt;

    <para>Loading several large blobs from /lib/firmware takes a noticeable
    time, during which the screen will be blank. If you do not enable the
    penguin framebuffer logo, or change the console size by using a bigger
    font, that probably does not matter. If desired, you can slightly
    reduce the time if you follow the alternate method of specifying 'y' for
    CONFIG_DRM_RADEON covered in BLFS at the link above &mdash; you must specify each
    needed radeon blob if you do that.</para>

    necessary download the firmware and put it in the specified directory in
    /lib/firmware so that it will be found on subsequent boots. Note that with
    current kernels this works whether or not the driver is compiled in or
    built as a module, there is no need to build this firmware into the kernel.
    Here is an example where the R8169 driver has been compiled in but the
