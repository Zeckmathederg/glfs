<title>Decent Rescue Boot Device Needs</title>
<para>This section is really about creating a <emphasis>rescue</emphasis>
device.  As the name <emphasis>rescue</emphasis> implies, the host
system has a problem, often lost partition information or corrupted file
systems, that prevent it from booting and/or operating normally.  For
this reason, you <emphasis>must not</emphasis> depend on resources from
the host being "rescued".  To presume that any given partition or hard
drive <emphasis>will</emphasis> be available is a risky presumption.</para>

<para>In a modern system, there are many devices that can be
used as a rescue device: floppy, cdrom, usb drive, or even a network card.  
Which one you use depends on your hardware and your BIOS.  In the past,
we usually thought of rescue device as a floppy disk.  Today, many
systems do not even have a floppy drive.</para>

<para>Building a complete rescue device is a challenging task.  In many 
ways, it is equivalent to building an entire <acronym>LFS</acronym> system.
In addition, it would be a repitition of information already available.
For these reasons, the procedures for a rescue device image are not
presented here.</para>

<title>Creating a Rescue Floppy</title>

<para>The software of today's systems has grown large.  Linux 2.6 no longer
supports booting directly from a floppy.  In spite of this, there are solutions
available using older version of Linux.  One of the best is Tom's Root/Boot
Disk available at <ulink url='http://www.toms.net/rb/'/>.  This will provide a
minimal Linux system on a single floppy disk and provides the ability to
customize the contents of your disk if necessary.</para>

<title>Creating a Bootable CD-ROM</title>

<para>There are several sources that can be used for a rescue CD-ROM.
Just about any commercial distribution's installation CD-ROMs or
DVDs will work.  These include RedHat, Mandrake, and SuSE.  One 
very popular option is Knoppix.</para>

<para>In addition, the LFS Community has developed its own Boot 
CD-ROM available at <ulink url='ftp://ftp.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs-boot-cd'/>.
A copy of this CD-ROM is available with the printed version of the Linux
From Scratch book.  If you download the ISO image, use <xref linkend='cdrecord'/> to
copy the image to a CD-ROM.</para>

<para>In the future, the build instructions for this CD-ROM will be presented,
but they are not available at this writing.</para>

<title>Creating a Bootable USB Drive</title>

<para>A USB Pen drive, sometimes called a Thumb drive, is recognized by Linux as
a SCSI device.  Using one of these devices as a rescue device has the advantage
that it is usually large enough to hold more than a minimal boot image.  You
can save critical data to the drive as well as use it to diagnose and recover
a damaged system.  Booting such a drive requires BIOS support, but building the
system consists of formatting the drive, adding <application>grub</application>
as well as the kernel and supporting files.</para>
