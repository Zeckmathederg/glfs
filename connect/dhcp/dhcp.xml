  <title>DHCP Clients</title>

  <para>DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol 
  used by many sites to automatically provide information such as IP addresses, 
  subnet masks and routing information to computers.  If your network uses 
  DHCP, you will need a DHCP client in order to connect to it. 
  DHCP is also used by some cable modems.</para>

  <para>BLFS currently provides installation instructions for 
  two DHCP clients, <command>dhclient</command> (from the 
  <application>dhcp</application> package) and <command>dhcpcd</command>. 
  BLFS presents both sets of installation instructions and 
  discusses how to create an appropriate service script to work with the 
  <command>network</command> bootscript and the DHCP 
  client of your choice.</para>
