  <title>Welcome to GLFS</title>

  <para>
    The GLFS book is designed to be taken in optional chunks
    and cover most setups users might be using. It is different
    from both LFS and BLFS in that LFS is meant to be followed
    almost command by command unless otherwise told so, and BLFS
    has packages scattered throughout in chapters, only certain
    ones meant to be followed through, such as X11.

  <para>
    Please read <xref linkend="whichsections"/> for more
    information regarding that. Along with that, please read most
    of this section carefully as it explains important conventions
    to help you if you were to get lost or stuck.
