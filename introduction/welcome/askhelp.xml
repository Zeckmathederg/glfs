  <title>Asking for Help</title>

  <para>
    Make an issue on <ulink url="https://github.com/Zeckmathederg/glfs"/>,
    and responses will be swift. Making repeat issues or asking questions
    that have already been answered is alright, but doing some research
    beforehand is appreciated.
  </para>

  <para>
    GLFS also does not have any mailing lists so making issues is the best
    way to get support or report issues with the book's instructions.
