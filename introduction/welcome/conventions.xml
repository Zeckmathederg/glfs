<title>Conventions used in this book</title>

<para>To make things easy to follow, there are a number of conventions used
throughout the book.  Following are some examples:</para>

<screen><command>./configure --prefix=/usr</command></screen>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is designed to be typed exactly 
as seen unless otherwise noted in the surrounding text.  It is also used 
in the explanation sections to identify references to specific commands.</para>
</blockquote>

<para><filename>install-info: unknown option 
`--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'</filename></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text (fixed width text) is showing screen 
output, probably as the result of commands issued and is also used to 
show filenames such as <filename>/boot/grub/grub.conf</filename></para></blockquote>

<para><emphasis>Emphasis</emphasis></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for several purposes in the 
book but mainly to emphasize important points or to give examples as to 
what to type.</para></blockquote>

<para><ulink url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/</ulink></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for hypertext links, both within 
the book and to external pages such as HowTo's, download locations,
websites, etc.</para></blockquote>

<screen><userinput><command>cat &gt; $LFS/etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"</command>
	root:x:0:
	bin:x:1:
	......
<command>EOF</command></userinput></screen>

<blockquote><para>This type of section is used mainly when creating 
configuration files.  The first command (in bold) tells the system to create 
the file <filename>$LFS/etc/group</filename> from whatever is typed on the 
following lines until the sequence <acronym>EOF</acronym> is encountered. 
Therefore, this whole section is generally typed as seen.</para></blockquote>

<para><replaceable>[REPLACED TEXT]</replaceable></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used to encapsulate text that should be
modified and is not to be typed as seen or copy and pasted.</para></blockquote>
