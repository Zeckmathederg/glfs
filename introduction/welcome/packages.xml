<title>Getting the Source Packages</title>

<para>Within the BLFS instructions, each package has two references for
finding the source files for the package&mdash;a http link and an ftp link.
Every effort has been made to ensure that these links are accurate.
Howerver, the World Wide Web is in continuous flux.  Packages are 
moved or updated and the exact URL specified is not always available.</para>

<para>To overcome this problem, the BLFS Team, with the assistance of <ulink
url='http://www.serverbeach.com'>Server Beach</ulink>, has made a http/ftp site
available at <emphasis>anduin.linuxfromscratch.org</emphasis>.  This site 
has all the sources of the
exact versions of the packages used in BLFS.  If you can't find the BLFS
package you need, get it there.</para>

<para>We would like to ask a favor, however.  Although this is a public
resource for you to use, we do not want to abuse it.  We have already had one
unthinking individual download over 3 GB of data, including multiple copies of
the same files that are placed at different locations (via symlinks) to make
finding the right package easier.  This person clearly did not know what files
he needed and downloaded everything.  The best place to download files
is the site or sites set up by the source code developer.  Please try
there first.</para>
