  <title>Optional Patches</title>

  <para>As you follow the various sections in the book, you will observe that
  the book occasionally includes patches that are required for a successful and
  secure installation of the packages. The general policy of the book is to
  include patches that fall in one of the following criteria:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Fixes a compilation problem.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Fixes a security problem.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Fixes a broken functionality.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>In short, the book only includes patches that are either required or
  recommended. There is a
  <ulink url="https://www.&lfs-domainname;/patches">Patches subproject</ulink>
  which hosts various patches (including the patches referenced in the books)
  to enable you to configure your LFS the way you like it.</para>
