    <title>Introduction to Rust</title>
    <para>
      The <application>Rust</application> programming language is designed
      to be a safe, concurrent, practical language.
    </para>

    <para>
      This package is updated on a six-weekly release cycle. Because it is
      such a large and slow package to build, is at the moment only required
      by a few packages in this book, and particularly because newer versions
      tend to break older mozilla packages, the BLFS editors take the view that
      it should only be updated when that is necessary (either to fix problems,
      or to allow a new version of a package to build).
    </para>

    <para>
      As with many  other programming languages, rustc (the rust compiler)
      needs a binary from which to bootstrap. It will download a stage0
      binary at the start of the build, so you cannot compile it without an
      Internet connection.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Although BLFS usually installs in <filename
        class="directory">/usr</filename>, when you later upgrade to a newer
        version of <application>rust</application> the old libraries in <filename
        class="directory">/usr/lib/rustlib</filename> will remain, with various
        hashes in their names, but will not be usable and will waste space. The
        editors recommend placing the files in the <filename
        class="directory">/opt</filename> directory.  In particular, if you
        have reason to rebuild with a modified configuration (e.g. using the
        shipped LLVM after building with shared LLVM, perhaps to compile crates
        for architectures which the BLFS LLVM build does not support)
        it is possible for the install to leave a broken
        <command>cargo</command> program. In such a situation, either remove
        the existing installation first, or use a different prefix such as
        /opt/rustc-&rust-version;-build2.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you prefer, you can of course change the prefix to <filename
        class="directory">/usr</filename>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      The current <application>rustbuild</application> build-system will use
      all processors, although it does not scale well and often falls
      back to just using one core while waiting for a library to compile.
      However it can be mostly limited to a specified number of processors by
      a combination of adding the switch <literal>--jobs &lt;N&gt;</literal>
      (e.g. '--jobs 4' to limit to 4 processors) on each invocation of
      <command>python3 ./x.py</command> <emphasis>and</emphasis> using an
      environment variable <envar>CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=&lt;N&gt;</envar>. At the
      moment this is not effective when some of the rustc tests are run.
    </para>

    <para>
      The current version of rust's num_cpus crate now recognizes that cgroups
      can be used to restrict which processors it is allowed to use. So if your
      machine lacks DRAM (typically, less than 2GB DRAM per core) that might be
      an alternative to taking CPUs offline.
      <phrase revision="sysv">In sysv systems cgroups requires <ulink
      url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/libcg/">libcgroup</ulink>.</phrase>
      <phrase revision="systemd">That can be achieved by using
      <command>systemd-run</command> command with
      <parameter>-p User=$(whoami)</parameter> and
      <parameter>-p AllowedCPUs=0-<replaceable>x</replaceable></parameter>
      (with <replaceable>x</replaceable> replaced with the number of CPU
      cores you want to use minus one) options.</phrase>
    </para>

    <para>
      At the moment <application>Rust</application> does not provide any
      guarantees of a stable ABI.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Rustc defaults to building for ALL supported architectures, using a
        shipped copy of LLVM. In BLFS the build is only for the X86
        architecture.
        If you intend to develop rust crates, this build may not be good
        enough for your purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
        The build times of this version when repeated on the same machine are
        often reasonably consistent, but as with all compilations using
        <command>rustc</command> there can be some very slow outliers.

      <para>
        Currently Rust compiler produces SSE2 instructions for 32-bit x86,
        causing the generated code broken on 32-bit systems without a
        SSE2-capable processor.  All x86 processor models released after
        2004 should be SSE2-capable.  Run
        <command>lscpu | grep sse2</command> as a test.  If it outputs
        anything, your CPU is SSE2-capable and OK.  Otherwise you may try
        to build this package <emphasis>on a SSE2-capable system</emphasis>

    </para>

    <para>
      As with all large test suites, other tests might fail on some machines -
      if the number of additional failures is in the single digits,
      check the log for 'failures:' and review lines above that, particularly the

    </para>

    <para>
      If you get any <emphasis>other</emphasis> failing test which reports an
      issue number then you should search for that issue.  For example, when
      rustc &gt;= 1.41.1 was built with a version of sysllvm before 10.0 the test
      for issue 69225 failed <ulink
      url="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/69225"/> and that should be
      regarded as a critical failure (they released 1.41.1 because of it).
      Most other failures will not be critical.

    <para>
      Therefore, you should determine the number of failures.
