    <title>Introduction to Rust</title>

    <para>
      The <application>Rust</application> programming language is designed
      to be a safe, concurrent, practical language.
    </para>

    <para>
      This package is updated on a six-weekly release cycle. Because it is
      such a large and slow package to build, and is at the moment only required
      by five packages in this book, the BLFS editors take the view that it
      should only be updated when that is necessary (either to fix problems,
      or to allow a new version of <application>firefox</application> to build).
    </para>

    <para>
      As with many  other programming languages, rustc (the rust compiler)
      needs a binary from which to bootstrap. It will download a stage0 binary
      and many cargo crates (these are actually .tar.gz source archives) at
      the start of the build, so you cannot compile it without an internet
      connection.
    </para>

    <para>
      These crates will then remain in various forms (cache, directories of
      extracted source), in <filename class="directory">~/.cargo</filename> for
      ever more. It is common for large <application>rust</application> packages
      to use multiple versions of some crates. If you purge the files before
      updating this package, very few crates will need to be updated by the
      packages in this book which use it (and they will be downloaded as
      required). But if you retain an older version as a fallback option and
      then use it (when <emphasis>not</emphasis> building in
      <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>), it is likely that it will
      then have to re-download some crates. For a full download (i.e. starting
      with an empty or missing <filename class="directory">~/.cargo</filename>)
      downloading the external cargo files for this version only takes a minute
      or so on a fast network.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Although BLFS usually installs in <filename
        class="directory">/usr</filename>, when you later upgrade to a newer
        version of <application>rust</application> the old libraries in <filename
        class="directory">/usr/lib/rustlib</filename> will remain, with various
        hashes in their names, but will not be usable and will waste space. The
        editors recommend placing the files in the <filename
        class="directory">/opt</filename> directory.  In particular, if you
        have reason to rebuild with a modified configuration (e.g. using the
        shipped LLVM after building with shared LLVM, but perhaps also the
        reverse situation) it it possible for the install to leave a broken
        <command>cargo</command> program. In such a situation, either remove
        the existing installation first, or use a different prefix such as
        /opt/rustc-&rust-version;-build2.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you prefer, you can of course change the prefix to <filename
        class="directory">/usr</filename> and omit the
        <command>ldconfig</command> and the actions to add rustc to the PATH.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      The current <application>rustbuild</application> build-system will use
      all available processors, although it does not scale well and often falls
      back to just using one core while waiting for a library to compile.
    </para>

    <para>
      At the moment <application>Rust</application> does not provide any
      guarantees of a stable ABI.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Rustc defaults to building for ALL supported architectures, using a
        shipped copy of LLVM. In BLFS the build is only for the X86
        architecture. Rustc still claims to require Python 2, but that is only
        really necessary when building some other architectures with the
        shipped LLVM.
        If you intend to develop rust crates, this build may not be good
        enough for your purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
        Unlike with previous versions, the build times of this version when
       repeated on the same machine seem reasonably consistent.
      </para>
      <para>
        Unusually, a DESTDIR-style method is being used to install this package.
        This is because running the install as root not only downloads all of the
        cargo files again (to <filename>/root/.cargo</filename>), it then spends
        a very long time recompiling. Using this method saves a lot of time, at
        the cost of extra disk space.

        The testsuite will generate some messages in the
        <phrase revision="sysv">system log</phrase>
        <phrase revision="systemd">systemd journal</phrase>
        for traps on invalid opcodes, and for segmentation faults.
        In themselves these are nothing to worry about, just a way for the
        test to be terminated. But if the output from the testsuite reports tests
        which FAIL with segmentation faults (signal 11) then there may be a
        problem.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      To run the tests issue <command>python3 ./x.py test --verbose
      --no-fail-fast | tee rustc-testlog</command>: as with the build, that
      will use all available CPUs.
    </para>

    <para>
      The instructions above do not build ARM compilers, so the testsuite
      <emphasis>will</emphasis> fail and the tests will be reported to end in
      error, with a backtrace of the last failing test. On a good run, 3 tests
      which need Thumb (ARM) compilers will fail, all in <filename
      class="directory">ui/issues</filename> for issues 37131, 49851 and 50993.
      If <xref linkend="python2"/> is not installed, a fourth test,
      <filename>run-make-fulldeps/sysroot-crates-are-unstable</filename>
      fails. If gdb has been installed, in some circumstances three tests in
      <filename class="directory">debuginfo</filename> also fail. As with all
      large testsuites, other tests might
      fail on some machines - if the number of failures is in the single digits,
      check the log for 'FAILED' and review lines above that. Any mention of
      SIGSEGV or signal 11 in a failing test is a cause for concern.
    </para>

    <para>
      Therefore, you should determine the number of tests, failures, etc. The
      total number of tests which were considered is found by running:
    </para>

<screen><command>grep 'running .* tests' rustc-testlog | awk '{ sum += $2 } END { print sum }'</command></screen>

    <para>
      That should report 15795 tests. Similarly, the total tests which failed can
      be found by running:
    </para>

<screen><command>grep '^test result:' rustc-testlog | awk  '{ sum += $6 } END { print sum }'</command></screen>

    <para>
      And similarly for the tests which passed use $4, for those which were ignored
      (i.e. skipped) use $8 (and $10 for 'measured', $12 for 'filtered out' but both
      are probably zero). The breakdown does not quite match the overall total.
    </para>

    <para>
      Still as your normal user, do a DESTDIR install:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>export LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1 &amp;&amp;
DESTDIR=${PWD}/install python3 ./x.py install &amp;&amp;
unset LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Now, as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user
      install the files from the DESTDIR:
    </para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>chown -R root:root install &amp;&amp;
cp -a install/* /</userinput></screen>

  <sect2 role="commands">
    <title>Command Explanations</title>

    <para>
      <command>ln -svfn rustc-&rust-version; /opt/rustc</command>: if this is
      not the first use of the <filename class="directory">/opt/rustc</filename>
      symlink, overwrite it by forcing, and use the '-n' flag to avoid getting
      confusing results from e.g. <command>ls -l</command>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>targets = "X86"</command>: this avoids building all the available
      linux cross-compilers (Aarch64, MIPS, PowerPC, SystemZ, etc). Unfortunately,
      rust insists on installing source files for these below
      <filename class="directory">/usr/lib/rustlib/src</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>extended = true</command>: this installs Cargo alongside Rust.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>channel = "stable"</command>: this ensures only stable features
      can be used, the default in <filename>config.toml</filename> is to use
      development features, which is not appropriate for a released version.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>rpath = false</command>: by default, <command>rust</command> can
      be run from where it was built, without being installed. That adds DT_RPATH
      entries to all of the ELF files, which produces very messy output from
      <command>ldd</command>, showing the libraries in the place they were built,
      even if they have been deleted from there after the install.

      <command>export RUSTFLAGS="$RUSTFLAGS -C link-args=-lffi"</command>:
      This adds a link to libffi to any RUSTFLAGS you may already be passing
      to the build. On some systems, linking fails to include libffi unless
      this is used. The reason why this is needed is not clear.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>--exclude src/tools/miri</command>: For a long time, the miri
      crate (an interpreter for the Midlevel Intermediate Representation)
      has failed to build on releases. It is optional, but the failure
      messages can persuade people that the whole build failed.

      information about a test which fails.
    </para>

      will not stop at the first error.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>export LIBSSH2_SYS_USE_PKG_CONFIG=1</command>: On some systems,
      cairo fails to link during the install because it cannot find libssh2.
      This seems to fix it, but again the reason why the problem occurs is not
      understood.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>DESTDIR=${PWD}/install python3 ./x.py install</command>: This
      effects a DESTDIR-style install in the source tree,creating an <filename

      need an absolute path, passing 'install' will not work.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>chown -R root:root install</command>: the DESTDIR install
