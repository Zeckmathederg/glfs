  <title>Who Would Want to Read this Book</title>

  <para>
    This book is aimed towards users who want to use a system following
    the Linux From Scratch book but also want to use <application>Steam
    </application> and/or <application>Wine</application>.
    The official Linux From Scratch and Beyond Linux From Scratch books
    do not support, and the maintainers do not wish to support, these two
    packages for the forseeable future. However, users should still have
    both the choice, and an easy to follow guide, to get these packages
    working on their system.
