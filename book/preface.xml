    <title>Foreword</title>
    
    <para>Having helped out with Linux From Scratch for a short time, I
    noticed that we were getting many queries as to how to do things beyond
    the base LFS system.  At the time, the only assistance specifically offered 
    relating to LFS were the LFS hints (<ulink url="&hints-root;"/>). 
    Most of the LFS hints are extremely good and well written 
    but I (and others) could still see a need for more comprehensive help to 
    go Beyond LFS - hence BLFS.</para>
    
    <para>BLFS aims to be more than the LFS-hints converted to XML although
    much of our work is based around the hints and indeed some authors write
    both hints and the relevant BLFS sections.  We hope that we can provide 
    you with enough information to not only manage to build your ystem up to 
    what you want, whether it be a web server or a multimedia desktop system, 
    but also that you will learn a lot about system configuration as you go.</para>
    
    <para>Thanks as ever go to everyone in the LFS/BLFS 
    community; especially those who have contributed instructions, written text, 
    answered questions and generally shouted when things were wrong!</para>
    
    <para>Finally, we encourage you to become involved in the community; ask 
    questions on the mailing list or news gateway and join in the fun on #lfs at 
    irc.linuxfromscratch.org. You can find more details about all of these in the 
    <xref linkend="introduction"/> section of the book.</para>
    
    <para>Enjoy using BLFS.</para>

    <para>I still remember how I found the BLFS project
    and started using the instructions that were completed at the time.  I could 
    not believe how wonderful it was to get an application up and running very 
    quickly, with explanations as to why things were done a certain way.
    Unfortunately, for me, it wasn't long before I was opening applications that 
    had nothing more  than "To be done" on the page.  I did what most would do, 
    I waited for someone else to do it.  It wasn't too long before I am looking 
    through  <application>Bugzilla</application> for something easy to do.
    As with any learning experience, the definition of what was easy kept
    changing.</para>
    
    <para>We still encourage you to become involved as BLFS is 
    never really finished.  Contributing or just using, we hope you enjoy
    your BLFS experience.</para>

    <para>The BLFS project is a natural progression of
    LFS.  Together, these projects provide a unique resource for
    the Open Source Community.  They take the mystery out of the process of
    building a complete, funtional software system from the source code contibuted
    by many talented individuals throughout the world.  They truly allow users 
    to implement the slogan "Your distro, your rules."</para>
    
    <para>Our goal is to continue to provide the best resoure available that shows
    you how to integrate many significant Open Source applications.  Since these
    applications are constantly updated and new applications are developed, this
    book will never be complete.  Additionally, there is always room for
    improvement in explaining the nuances of how to install the different packages.
    To make these improvements, we need your feedback.  I encourage you to
    participate on the different mailing lists, news groups, and
    IRC channels to help meet these goals.</para>

      <title>Preface to Version 6.0</title>
      
      <para>Version 6.0 is a major milestone in the evolution of BLFS.  This
      version provides installation instructions for 357 packages and an additional
      21 sections covering configuration and customization of different aspects 
      of your system.</para>
      
      <para>Changes and upgrades to the individual packages are detailed in the
      <xref linkend='intro-welcome-changelog'/>.  There you will see literally hundreds of
      changes made since the last edition.  In this change log, one name that you
      will see over and over is Randy McMurchy.  Without his efforts this
      release would not have been possible.  I want to take this opportunity to thank
      him for the hundreds of hours he has worked to produce this release.  I
      also want to thank the other editors, both past and present, whose insight
      and effort have made this current version possible.  Last, but certainly not least,
      I want to thank our resident XSL wizard, Manuel Canales Esparcia, whose
      ability to format a complicated document such as BLFS is truly amazing.</para>
      
      <para>There are two other areas of change that are worthy of note.  First,
      the license that BLFS is released under has changed significantly.  In
      fact, it is now released under two licenses.  The first license, the
      <xref linkend='CC'/>, covers the descriptive text in the book. The second, the
      <xref linkend='AFL'/>, covers the instructions actually used to build and
      install the packages.  These licenses, along with the book itself, represent
      our ongoing commitment to open and free sofware.</para>
      
      <para>The final area of change is the addition of an Index.  This section of
      the book is still incomplete, but as the book continues to be developed,
      will become an excellent resource for finding programs, libraries,
      configuration files, and references to kernel configuration requirements.  I
      hope you find it useful.</para>

    <title>Who Would Want to Read this Book</title>
    
    <para>This book is mainly aimed at those who have built a system based
    on the LFS book.  It will also be useful for those who are 
    using other distributions, but for one reason or another want to manually build
    software and are in need of some assistance.  BLFS can be 
    used to create a range of diverse systems and so the target audience is 
    probably nearly as wide as that of the LFS book.  If you 
    found LFS useful, you should also like this!</para>
    
    <para>Since Release 5.0, the BLFS book version matches
    the LFS book version. This book may be incompatible with
    a previous or latter release of the LFS book.</para>
