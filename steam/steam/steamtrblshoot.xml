  <title>Troubleshooting Steam</title>

  <para>
    On normal Linux distributions, there is not much work to be done after
    installing <application>Steam</application>. Just launch it, wait for it
    to download the newest runtime, login, install Proton, then start playing
    the games/apps you just installed. Currently on an LFS system with current
    GLFS packages and configuration, getting games and apps to work takes one
    more step, one that must be repeated for every game and app you install.

    <title>Launch Options</title>

    <para>
      Any game or app, native or not, will fail to launch for an unknown reason.
      It will attempt to launch, and by the time a window should be created, Steam
      will fail and shut down the process. This can be resolved by going into the
      game or app's launch options and set the following:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>LD_PRELOAD="" %command%</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      The game or app should now proceed to launch just fine. Work is being done
      here and there to find out why it is necessary for every game or app, but
      it might be failing to find libraries in <filename>/run/host</filename>,
      despite libraries being located in <filename>/lib</filename>, and if you're
      on x86_64 and did multilib, <filename>/lib32</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the steam overlay is desired, enter the following launch option instead:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>LD_PRELOAD="$HOME/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_64/gameoverlayrenderer.so" %command%</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      This launch option loads a library necessary for the steam overlay to function.
