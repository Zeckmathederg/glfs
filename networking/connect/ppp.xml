      <title>Configuration Information</title>

      <para>The <application>PPP</application> daemon requires some
      configuration. The main trick is scripting the connection.
      For dialup and GPRS connections, this can be done
      either using the <command>chat</command> program which comes with
      this package, or by using external tools such as
      <ulink url="http://alumnit.ca/wiki/?WvDial">WvDial</ulink>
      or <application>KPPP</application> from
      <xref linkend="kdenetwork"/>. The text below explains how to set up
      dialup, GPRS and PPPoE connections using only tools provided with
      the <application>PPP</application> package. All configuration steps
      in this section are executed as the
      <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user.</para>

      <para>Add the users who may run <application>PPP</application> to the

      <title>Dialup Modem Connection</title>
<!-- This section has been tested with various ISPs in Yekaterinburg,
     Russia using Lucent WinModem. I cannot test it anymore, because
     there is no free PCI slot for the modem in my new computer. However,
     it is similar enough to GPRS for me to be sure that it still works,
     and nobody complained about non-working dialup on the LFS LiveCD.
     - Alexander E. Patrakov -->

      <para>Dialup connections are established with the help of a modem
      connected to a computer and the telephone line. The modem dials a
      telephone number of the ISP's modem, and they exchange data using
      the signal frequencies 300-4000 Hz. Typical data transfer
      rate is 40-50 kilobits per second, and the gateway ping time
      (latency) is up to 300-400 ms. In order to configure the
      dialup connection, it is required to know the telephone number of
      the ISP's modem pool, the username and the password.</para>

      <para>In order to configure a dialup connection, two files have to
      be created: a chat script that automates the connection procedure
      (common for all dialup accounts), and a peer file that provides
      configuration information about a specific connection to
      <command>pppd</command>:</para>

      <para>The first three lines of the
      <filename>/etc/ppp/dialup.chat</filename> file abort the script when
      it receives an indication of an error from the modem. Then the timeout
      is set to 5 seconds and the script checks that the modem responds to
      the dummy AT command. If not, measures are taken to dewedge it
      (by interrupting the data transfer and going on hook). Then the
      telephone number is dialed, and the script waits for the answer for
      75 seconds. The serial connection is considered established when the
      modem sends the string CONNECT.</para>

      <title>GPRS and EDGE Connections</title>
<!-- This section has been tested with GPRS service from MOTIV in
     Yekaterinburg, Russia. According to forum messages, the procedure
     also works with EDGE, but my cellular phone (Motorola C350) does not
     support EDGE. - Alexander E. Patrakov -->

      <para>GPRS and EDGE connections are established with the help of a
      cellular phone connected to a computer via serial, USB, or Bluetooth.
      The phone exchanges data packets with the nearest base station,
      which can be up to 35 kilometers away.

      <!-- FIXME: watch for new standards! SkyLink is already offering
           3.1 megabits per second with CDMA mobile phones, and
           the configuration below doesn't work. It is reported that
           a regular dialup setup with the telephone number "#777",
           username "mobile" and password "internet" works with SkyLink. -->

      The maximum possible data transfer rate is 170 kilobits per second
      for GPRS and 474 kilobits per second for EDGE, but many cellular
      operators impose lower limits, such as 64 kilobits per second. The
      gateway ping time is 900 ms for GPRS, which makes playing many online
      games impossible and causes connection to ICQ to be unreliable.
      In order to configure a GPRS or EDGE connection,
      it is required to know the access point name (APN) and, rarely, the
      username and the password.
      In most cases, billing is based on the telephone number, and the
      username/password pair is not needed, as assumed in the example
      below.</para>

      <title>PPPoE connections</title>

      <!-- This section has been tested with the "USI" ISP in Yekaterinburg,
      Russia. Other editors can test it as described in
      http://linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/blfs-dev/2008-March/018290.html
      - Alexander E. Patrakov -->

      <para>PPPoE connections are established over Ethernet, typically between
      a computer and an ADSL router (usually installed in the same room)
      that forwards the packets down the telephone line using frequencies
      25-2500 kHz, thus not interfering with voice calls. Although the router
      can, in theory, forward any Ethernet packet, PPP encapsulation is used
      for password-based authentication, so that the ISP can limit the
      bandwidth and charge money according to the chosen tariff. The maximum
      data transfer rate on ADSL is 24 megabits per second, and the gateway
      ping time is typically less than 10 ms. In order to configure a PPPoE
      connection, it is required to know the username, the password, and,
      sometimes, the service name and/or the access concentrator name.</para>

      <para>In order to configure a PPPoE connection, only the peer file

      <title>Bringing up PPPoE connection at boot time</title>
      <para>If your service provider does not charge by the minute, it is
      usually good to have a bootscript handle the connection for you.
      You can, of course, choose not to install the following script, and
      start your connection manually with the <command>pon</command> command,
      as described above. If you wish your PPPoE connection to be brought
      up at boot time, run:</para>

<screen role='root'><userinput>make install-service-pppoe</userinput></screen>

      <para>The above command installs the <filename>pppoe</filename>
      service script and the <filename>/etc/ppp/peers/pppoe</filename>
      file with some settings that make sense for most PPPoE connections.
      The bootscript calls <command>pppd</command> with the the following
      options:</para>

<screen>pppd call pppoe ${1} linkname ${1} ${PPP_OPTS}</screen>

      <para>Here <quote>${1}</quote> is the network interface name,
      <quote>linkname ${1}</quote> is added for creation of the
      <filename>/var/run/ppp-${1}.pid</filename> file with the
      <command>pppd</command> process ID (to be used when bringing
      the connection down), and the <quote>${PPP_OPTS}</quote> variable
      contains user-specified options such as <quote>user</quote> and
      <quote>remotename</quote>.</para>

      <para>Now create the config file for use with the <filename>pppoe</filename>
      service script:</para>

<screen role='root'><userinput>install -v -d /etc/sysconfig/network-devices/ifconfig.eth0 &amp;&amp;

      <note><para>Instead of specifying additional options in the $PPP_OPTS
      variable, you can also edit the <filename>/etc/ppp/peers/pppoe</filename>
