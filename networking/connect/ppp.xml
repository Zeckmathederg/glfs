      <para>Most internet service providers that use ppp give you a username
      and password for you to use to authenticate yourself when you connect to
      their servers. These secrets are kept in the files
      <filename>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</filename> or
      <filename>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</filename>. If you don't know whether
      your ISP uses CHAP or PAP then create both files and put the same content
      in both files.</para>

      <para>If you have more than one ISP account the second column
      (remotename) is used to identify between the different
      usernames/passwords needed for the different ISPs. If you only have one
      ISP account an asterisk will work fine in the second column.</para>

      <para>In this example the username given by the ISP is
      <quote>jdoe</quote>, the password is <quote>guessit</quote>, the ISP uses
      PAP and the user wants to give this account the remotename
      <quote>dialup</quote> in order to distinguish it from other PPP
      accounts:</para>

      <title>Dialup Modem Connection</title>

<!-- This section has been tested with various ISPs in Yekaterinburg,
     Russia using Lucent WinModem. I cannot test it anymore, because
     there is no free PCI slot for the modem in my new computer. However,
     it is similar enough to GPRS for me to be sure that it still works,
     and nobody complained about non-working dialup on the LFS LiveCD.
     - Alexander E. Patrakov -->

      <para>Dialup connections are established with the help of a modem
      connected to a computer and the telephone line. The modem dials a
      telephone number of the ISP's modem, and they exchange data using
      the signal frequencies 300-4000 Hz. Typical data transfer
      rate is 40-50 kilobits per second, and the gateway ping time
      (latency) is up to 300-400 ms. In order to configure the
      dialup connection, it is required to know the telephone number of
      the ISP's modem pool, the username and the password.</para>

      <para>In order to configure a dialup connection, two files have to
      be created: a chat script that automates the connection procedure
      (common for all dialup accounts), and a peer file that provides
      configuration information about a specific connection to
      <command>pppd</command>:</para>

      <para>The first three lines of the
      <filename>/etc/ppp/dialup.chat</filename> file abort the script when
      it receives an indication of an error from the modem. Then the timeout
      is set to 5 seconds and the script checks that the modem responds to
      the dummy AT command. If not, measures are taken to dewedge it
      (by interrupting the data transfer and going on hook). Then the
      telephone number is dialed, and the script waits for the answer for
      75 seconds. The serial connection is considered established when the
      modem sends the string CONNECT.</para>

      <title>GPRS and EDGE Connections</title>

<!-- This section has been tested with GPRS service from MOTIV in
     Yekaterinburg, Russia. According to forum messages, the procedure
     also works with EDGE, but my cellular phone (Motorola C350) does not
     support EDGE. - Alexander E. Patrakov -->

      <para>GPRS and EDGE connections are established with the help of a
      cellular phone connected to a computer via serial, USB, or Bluetooth.
      The phone exchanges data packets with the nearest base station,
      which can be up to 35 kilometers away.

      <!-- FIXME: watch for new standards! SkyLink is already offering
           3.1 megabits per second with CDMA mobile phones, and
           the configuration below doesn't work. It is reported that
           a regular dialup setup with the telephone number "#777",
           username "mobile" and password "internet" works with SkyLink. -->

      The maximum possible data transfer rate is 170 kilobits per second
      for GPRS and 474 kilobits per second for EDGE, but many cellular
      operators impose lower limits, such as 64 kilobits per second. The
      gateway ping time is 900 ms for GPRS, which makes playing many online
      games impossible and causes connection to ICQ to be unreliable.
      In order to configure a GPRS or EDGE connection,
      it is required to know the access point name (APN) and, rarely, the
      username and the password.
      In most cases, billing is based on the telephone number, and the
      username/password pair is not needed, as assumed in the example
      below.</para>

      <para>In order to configure a GPRS connection, two files have to
      be created: a chat script that automates the connection procedure
      (common for all GPRS accounts), and a peer file that provides
