      The <application>cURL</application> package contains an utility

      the following protocols: FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP,

      and upload files can be incorporated into other programs to support
      functions like streaming media.

   For version 7.54.1 I got:

    </para>

    2017-10-29 - bdubbs
    For version 7.56.1 I had a lot of test failures which included long
    timeouts.  Could not determine the cause of the timeouts or failures,
    but I was missing c-ares, MIT Kerberos, ldap, samba, and the six
    external packages.

    2017-12-01 - bdubbs 
    Still a lot of test failures.  I did have c-ares, Kerberos, and ldap
    installed this time.  Best guess is that servers are not available.

    2018-08-01 - renodr
    No test failures, but I didn't have any of the optional dependencies except
    for c-ares and libidn2. I might re-run this test suite before release with
    all of the optional deps, but right now, it isn't a priority - rather
    the security fix is.
-->

    <para>
       To run the test suite, issue: <command>make test</command>. 
       Tests 323 and 1560 are known to fail.  A few other tests may fail
       randomly for unknown reasons.
    </para>
<!-- Two (of 857) tests
fail for unknown reasons, and all tests fail is valgrind is installed. Moving
valgrind out of $PATH is recommended if you wish to run the test suite while
it is installed.

         if stunnel and valgrind are not installed, and also most options
         (I had rtmpdump), the tests complete without problems.

Warning: dict server unexpectedly alive

         and no. I don't have smb - so commenting the rest of this:
      To run the test suite, issue: <command>make test</command>. Many tests 
      may fail that depend on optional dependencies that may not be installed
      or upstream servers that may not be available, especially for tests 
      numbered 700 and above.
      Test time may be significantly increase due to hanging tests that fail.

From the logs, both appear to be ipv6 releated.

Added by Douglas for curl-7.61.0:
TESTDONE: 961 tests out of 961 reported OK: 100%
TESTDONE: 1202 tests were considered during 338 seconds.
I only have c-ares and libidn2 installed, I will likely try before release
with all optional dependencies in the book installed.

=========
7.61.1 NOTE: The test suite is extremely noisy, complaining about verification errors.
It's possible this is due to openssl-1.1.1, BUT 79/79 tests report as 100% OK. I had
c-ares, libpsl, and libidn1/2 installed. - Doug

========
7.62.0: All tests passed. libpsl, c-ares, libssh2, libidn2 installed.
All 1098 tests report OK.

For dependencies, I had c-ares, gnutls, libidn2, libpsl, krb5, libssh2, nghttp2,
OpenLDAP, Samba, stunnel, and Valgrind installed.

The tests that fail seem to be somewhat random.  What happened between 
yesterday and today that that tests 1139 1140 1173 now fail?
