  <title>GPU Kernel Options and Firmware</title>

  <para>
    The Linux kernel has multiple drivers for all sorts of hardware,
    including GPUs, and most open source drivers are in the kernel.
    This includes AMD, i915, and Nouveau. There are other drivers
    as well that can be useful for certain users. Firmware is also
    necessary for many drivers.
  </para>

  <sect2 role="kernel" id="gpu-kernel" xreflabel='GPU Kernel Configuration'>
    <title>Kernel Configuration</title>

    <para>
	The kernel options below enable GPU and virtual GPU drivers.
	Enable the ones you need and recompile the kernel if necessary.
    </para>

    <xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="gpu-kernel.xml"/>

    <note>
    <para>
	There are comments for the options above, corresponding with Mesa's
	Gallium3D dri driver names.
    </para>

    <para>
	Selecting <option>CONFIG_DRM_RADEON</option> or
	<option>CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU</option> as
	<quote><literal>y</literal></quote> is not recommended. If it is, any
	required firmware must be built as a part of the kernel image or the
	initramfs for the driver to function correctly.
    </para>

    <para>
	The sub-entries under <option>CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU</option> are used
	to ensure the AMDGPU kernel driver supports all GPUs using the
	<literal>radeonsi</literal> driver.  They are not needed if you
	won't need <option>CONFIG_DRM_AMDGPU</option> itself. They
	may be unneeded for some GPU models.
    </para>

    <para>
	For <literal>swrast</literal>, <option>CONFIG_DRM_VGEM</option>
	is not strictly needed but recommended as an optimization.
    </para>

      <title>ATI Firmware</title>

      <para>
	ATI Radeon GPUs require firmware to be able to use KMS (kernel
	modesetting - the preferred option) as well as for Xorg. For
	older Radeon chips before r600, the firmware is in the kernel
	source. Later GPUs have their firmware in <application>
	linux-firmware</application>.
      </para>

      <para>
	In order to save space, it is recommended to use
	<xref linkend="pciutils"/> and it's packaged binary <command>
	lspci</command> to identify what the VGA controller is. After
	you find out that, check the RadeonFeature page of the Xorg
	wiki for 
	<ulink url="https://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/#index5h2">
	Decoder ring for engineering vs marketing names</ulink> to
	identify the family (you may need to know this for the Xorg
	driver — Southern Islands and Sea Islands use the radeonsi
	driver) and the specific model.
      </para>

      <para>
	Now that you know which controller you are using, consult the
	<ulink url="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Radeon#Firmware">
	Radeon Firmware</ulink> page of the Gentoo wiki which has a
	table listing the required firmware blobs for the various
	chipsets. Note that Southern Islands and Sea Islands chips
	use different firmware for kernel 3.17 and later compared to
	earlier kernels. Identify and download the required blobs
	then install them:

      <title>RadeonSI Firmware</title>

      <para>
	AMDGPU devices require firmware in order to be used in general.

    <sect3>
      <title>i915 Firmware</title>

      <para>
	Intel integrated GPUs from Skylake onwards can use firmware for
	GuC (the Graphics microcontroller), and also for the HuC
	(HEVC/H265 microcontroller which offloads to the GPU) and the
	DMC (Display Microcontroller) to provide additional low-power
	states. The GuC and HuC have had a chequered history in the
	kernel and updated firmware may be disabled by default,
	depending on your kernel version.Further details may be found at
	<ulink url="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/firmware/"/> and
	<ulink url="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/intel_graphics"/>.

      <title>Nouveau Firmware</title>

      <para>
	Nvidia GPUs from Kepler onwards require signed firmware, otherwise
	the nouveau driver is unable to provide hardware acceleration.
	Nvidia has now released firmware up to Ampere (GeForce30 series) to
	<application>linux-firmware</application>. Note that faster clocks
	than the default are not enabled by the released firmware.
