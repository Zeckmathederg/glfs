  <title>What is Wine?</title>

  <para>
    <application>Wine</application> is an application that allows users
    to execute Windows software via a compatibilty layer. Although the
    acronym of WINE (Wine Is Not Emulation) describes itself as not an
    emulator but as a compatabilty layer, many still see it as one.
  </para>

  <para>
    <application>Wine</application> is geared towards running normal
    Windows software whereas Steam's <application>Proton</application>
    is more geared towards playing games at high performance. Trying
    to run regular Windows software may be troublesome with <application>
    Proton</application> but is no trouble to <application>Wine</application>.
    Even some games run better on <application>Wine</application> but
    struggle or simply don't launch with <application>Proton</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
    As <application>Wine</application> deals with a foriegn format,
    it is to be expected that it depends on extra toolchains as well as
    other dependencies. Please check <xref linkend="winedeps"/> before
    continuing with this chapter.
