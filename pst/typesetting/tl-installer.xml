    <title>Introduction to TeX Live and its installer</title>

    <para>The <application>TeX Live</application> package is a comprehensive
    TeX document production system.  It includes TeX, LaTeX2e, ConTeXt,
    Metafont, MetaPost, BibTeX and many other programs; an extensive collection
    of macros, fonts and documentation; and support for typesetting in many
    different scripts from around the world.</para>

    <para>This page is for people who wish to use the binary installer to
    provide the programs, the scripts, and a lot of supporting files and
    documentation.  The installer is updated frequently, so its md5sum will
    change if it is newer than what is shown below.  Newer versions of the
    installer are expected to work with these instructions, for so long as they
    install to a
    <filename class="directory">&texlive-year;/</filename> directory.</para>

    <para>
      There are two reasons why you may wish to install the binaries in BLFS:
      either you need a smaller install (e.g. at a minimum plain TeX without
      LaTeX2e, ConTeXt, etc), or you wish to use <command>tlmgr</command> to
      get updates whilst this version is supported (typically, until April of
      the year after it was released). For the latter, you might prefer to
      install in your <filename class="directory">/home</filename> directory
      as an unprivileged user, and to then make corresponding changes to the
      PATH in your <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> or equivalent.

      As always with contributed binary software, it is possible that the required

    <title>Binary Installation of TeX Live</title>

    <para>The <application>TeX Live</application> set of programs with its
    supporting documents, fonts, and utilities is very large.  The upstream
    maintainers recommend placing all files in a single directory structure.
    BLFS recommends <filename class='directory'>/opt/texlive</filename>.</para>

    <para>As with any other package, unpack the installer and change into its
    directory, <filename class='directory'>install-tl-&lt;CCYYMMDD&gt;</filename>.
    This directory name changes when the installer is updated, so replace
    &lt;CCYYMMDD&gt; by the correct directory name.</para>

    <note>
    <para>
    The distribution binaries installed below may use static linking
    for general linux system libraries.  Additional libraries or interpreters
    as specified in the dependencies section do not need to be present during
    the install, but the programs that need them will not run until their
    specific dependencies have been installed.
    </para>

    <!-- please keep something like this in the future -->
    <para>
    With all contributed binary software, there may be a mismatch between the
    builder's toolchain and your hardware.  In most of TeX this will probably
    not matter, but in uncommon corner cases you might hit problems.
    e.g. if your x86_64 processor does not support 3dnowext or 3dnow, the
    2014-06-28 binary failed in conTeXt when running LuaTeX, although lualatex
    worked, as did the i686 binaries on the same machine. In such cases, the
    easiest solution is to install texlive from source. Similarly, the x86_64
    binary version of <command>asy</command> runs very slowly when creating 3-D
    diagrams.
    </para>
    </note>

    <para>Now, as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
    user:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/texlive ./install-tl</userinput></screen>

    <para>This command is interactive and allows selection or modification of
    platform, packages, directories, and other options.  The full installation
    scheme will require about 4.9 gigabytes of disk space.  The time to complete
    the download will depend on your internet connection speed and the
    number of packages selected.</para>
