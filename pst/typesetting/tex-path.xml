  <title>Setting the PATH for TeX Live</title>

  <para>
    Before starting to build TeX Live, set up your PATH so
    that the system can properly find the files.  If you set up your login
    scripts as recommended in <xref linkend='postlfs-config-profile'/>, update
    the needed paths by appending to the
    <filename>extrapaths.sh</filename> script. The programs are always
    installed in an &lt;ARCH&gt;-linux subdirectory and on 32-bit x86 this is
    always i386-linux. For x86_64 and i?86 we can generate this as $TEXARCH:
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      If upgrading from a previous year's version, you should manually
      edit <filename>extrapaths.sh</filename> to ensure that the version for
      the year you wish to use is the only TeX present (some people need to
      keep multiple years available to ensure there are no regressions in
      their documents).
    </para>
  </note>

<!-- EOF should NOT be in double quotes, we want it to evaluate $TEXARCH -->
<!-- this is also in texlive.xml -->
<screen role="root"><userinput>export TEXARCH=$(uname -m | sed -e 's/i.86/i386/' -e 's/$/-linux/') &amp;&amp;

cat &gt;&gt; /etc/profile.d/extrapaths.sh &lt;&lt; EOF
<literal>
# Begin texlive addition

pathappend /opt/texlive/&texlive-year;/texmf-dist/doc/man  MANPATH
pathappend /opt/texlive/&texlive-year;/texmf-dist/doc/info INFOPATH
pathappend /opt/texlive/&texlive-year;/bin/$TEXARCH

# End texlive addition
</literal>
EOF

unset TEXARCH</userinput></screen>


  <note>
    <para>
      The standard MANPATH and INFOPATH path are specified above to
      ensure they are included.  If they are already set in the boot script
      procedure, the pathappend function will ensure duplicates are
      removed, so including them here will do no harm.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    The new paths can be immediately activated by running <command>source
    /etc/profile</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
    You should now proceed either to <xref linkend="tl-installer"/> for
    a binary installation of texlive, or to <xref linkend="texlive"/> to begin
    installing from source.
  </para>
