Ok, so you have downloaded the XML source. Now what? You are probably
wanting to convert these XML files to easier to read HTML, PDF, TXT
or other formatted files.

To install the programs you need to generate these formats, you need
to have or install the following packages:

libxml2
libxslt
DocBook XSL Stylesheets-1.68.1
tidy                            (optional for html)
lynx                            (for text)
JDK-1.5                         (for pdf)
FOP                             (for pdf)

The intallation instructions for all these packages are available
in the BLFS book from one of the mirrors found at
http://beyond.linuxfromacratch.org.
