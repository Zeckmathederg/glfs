  <para><application>Xorg</application> is a freely redistributable,
  open-source implementation of the <application>X</application> Window
  System. This system provides a client/server interface between display
  hardware (the mouse, keyboard, and video displays) and the desktop
  environment, while also providing both the windowing infrastructure and a
  standardized application interface (API).</para>

  <bridgehead renderas="sect3">Xorg Download and Installation
  Instructions</bridgehead>

  <para>Xorg-7.0 introduced a completely auto-tooled, modular build system.
  With the new modular build system, it is no longer possible to download
  the entire package in a single file. In fact, there will be well over 100
  packages that need to be fetched from the download location. To assist
  with such a large task, installing <xref linkend="wget"/> is strongly
  recommended for downloading the needed files.  A complete
  <application>wget</application> file list is provided for each page
  that includes multiple packages.</para>

  <para>Given the number of packages available, deciding which packages you
  need to install for your particular setup may seem a bit overwhelming at
  first.  Take a look at
  <ulink url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModuleDescriptions">this page</ulink>
  and
  <ulink url="http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-modular/2005-November/000801.html">this thread</ulink>
  to get an idea of what you will need.  If you are unsure, you should
  install all packages at the cost of extra disk space.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Even if you intend to download only the necessary packages, you
    should download the wget file lists.  The list of files are ordered by
    dependency, and the package versions listed in the files are known to
    work well with each other. Further, the wget file lists contain comments
    for specific packages that are deprecated or are not recommended to
    install. Newer packages are likely intended for the
    next release of <application>Xorg</application> and have already proved
    to be incompatible with current versions of software installed in BLFS.
    The installed size of <application>Xorg</application> can be reduced
    considerably by installing only the packages that you will need and use,
    however, the BLFS book cannot account for all dependencies and build
    options for the individual <application>Xorg</application> packages.
    The instructions assume that all packages have been built.  A
    <ulink url="&blfs-wiki;/Xorg7">wiki</ulink>
    page containing dependency information is under development.  You are
    encouraged to add to these pages if you discover additional information
    that may be helpful to other users who selectively install individual
    packages.</para>
  </note>

  <para>Additionally, because of the large number of repetitive commands,
  you are encouraged to partially automate the build. Instructions have been
  given that utilize the <xref linkend="sudo"/> package. It is recommended that
  you use the <parameter>:NOPASSWD</parameter> configuration option for the
  user that will be building the xorg packages.</para>

  <sect2 id="xorg-env" xreflabel="Xorg build environment">
    <title>Setting up the Xorg Build Environment</title>

    <note><para>The following instructions assume that the shell
    startup files have been set up as described in
    <xref linkend="postlfs-config-profile" />.
    </para></note>

    <para>First, you'll need to create a working directory:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir xc &amp;&amp;
cd xc</userinput></screen>

    <para>As with previous releases of the X Window System, it may be
    desirable to install <application>Xorg</application> into an alternate
    prefix.  This is no longer common practice among Linux distributions.
    The common installation prefix for <application>Xorg</application> on
    Linux is <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>.  There is no
    standard alternate prefix, nor is there any exception in the current
    revision of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for Release 7 of the X
    Window System.  Alan Coopersmith of Sun Microsystems, has recently
    stated "At Sun, we were using
    <filename class="directory">/usr/X11</filename> and plan to stick with
    it."  Only the <filename class="directory">/opt/*</filename> prefix or
    the <filename class="directory">/usr</filename> prefix adhere to the
    current FHS guidelines.</para>

    <para>Choose your installation prefix, and set the
    <envar>XORG_PREFIX</envar> variable with the following
    command:</para>

<screen><userinput>export XORG_PREFIX="<replaceable>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</replaceable>"</userinput></screen>

    <para>Throughout these instructions, you will use the following
    <command>configure</command> switches for all of the packages.  Create the
    <envar>XORG_CONFIG</envar> variable to use for this parameter
    substitution:</para>

<screen><userinput>export XORG_CONFIG="--prefix=$XORG_PREFIX --sysconfdir=/etc \
    --localstatedir=/var --disable-static"</userinput></screen>

    <para>Create an <filename>/etc/profile.d/xorg.sh</filename> configuration
    file containing these variables as the
    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh &lt;&lt; EOF
XORG_PREFIX="$XORG_PREFIX"
XORG_CONFIG="--prefix=\$XORG_PREFIX --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --disable-static"
export XORG_PREFIX XORG_CONFIG
EOF
chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh</userinput></screen>

    <note><para>If you've decided to use the standard <filename
    class="directory">/usr</filename> prefix, you can omit the remainder of
    this page and continue at <xref linkend='util-macros'/>.</para></note>

    <para>If you've decided to <emphasis>not</emphasis> use the standard
    prefix, be sure to add <filename
    class="directory">$XORG_PREFIX/bin</filename> to your <envar>PATH</envar>
    environment variable, and <filename class="directory">
    $XORG_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig</filename> and <filename class="directory">
    $XORG_PREFIX/share/pkgconfig</filename> to your
    <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</envar> variable. It is also helpful to specify
    additional search paths for <command>gcc</command> and an include directory
    for the <command>aclocal</command> program.  Issue the following commands
    as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>cat &gt;&gt; /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh &lt;&lt; "EOF"

pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/bin             PATH
pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig   PKG_CONFIG_PATH
pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/share/pkgconfig PKG_CONFIG_PATH

pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/lib             LIBRARY_PATH
pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/include         C_INCLUDE_PATH
pathappend $XORG_PREFIX/include         CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

ACLOCAL="aclocal -I $XORG_PREFIX/share/aclocal"

export PATH PKG_CONFIG_PATH ACLOCAL LIBRARY_PATH C_INCLUDE_PATH CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
EOF</userinput></screen>

    <para>You should also add
    <filename class="directory"> $XORG_PREFIX/lib</filename> to the
    <filename>/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> file. Again, as the
    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user, issue the following
    command:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>echo "$XORG_PREFIX/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf</userinput></screen>

    <para>You should also modify
    <filename>/etc/man_db.conf</filename>, adding appropriate
    MANDATORY_MANPATH, MANPATH_MAP, and MANDB_MAP entries following the
    examples for <filename class="directory">/usr/X11R6</filename>. Issue the
    following command as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
    user:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>sed "s@<replaceable>/usr/X11R6</replaceable>@$XORG_PREFIX@g" -i /etc/man_db.conf</userinput></screen>

    <para>Some applications look for shared files in <filename
    class="directory">/usr/share/X11</filename>.  Create a symbolic link to the
    proper location as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
    user:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>ln -sf $XORG_PREFIX/share/X11 /usr/share/X11</userinput></screen>

    <para>If building KDE, some cmake files look for Xorg in places other than
    $XORG_PREFIX.  Allow cmake to find Xorg with:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>ln -sf $XORG_PREFIX /usr/X11R6</userinput></screen>
<!--
    <para>Finally, if building on x86_64, you will need to create the
    <filename class="directory">$XORG_PREFIX/lib</filename> directory and the
    <filename>$XORG_PREFIX/lib64</filename> symlink. Again, as the
    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user, issue the following
    commands:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>install -v -m755 -d $XORG_PREFIX &amp;&amp;
install -v -m755 -d $XORG_PREFIX/lib &amp;&amp;
ln -sf lib $XORG_PREFIX/lib64</userinput></screen>
