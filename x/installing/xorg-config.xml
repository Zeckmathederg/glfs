    <note><para>Before starting Xorg for the first time, is is useful to
    rebuild the library cache by running <userinput>ldconfig</userinput>
    as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user.</para></note>

    <para>To test the <application>Xorg</application> installation, issue
    <userinput>startx</userinput>.  This command brings up a rudimentary window
    manager called <emphasis>twm</emphasis> with three xterm windows and one
    xclock window.  The xterm window in the upper left is a login terminal and
    running <emphasis>exit</emphasis> from this terminal will exit the

    obscured on your system by the other two xterms.</para>

    <title>Checking the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) Installation</title>

    <para>
      DRI is a framework for allowing software to access graphics hardware in a safe and
      efficient manner. It is installed in <application>X</application> by default
      (using <application>Mesa</application>) if you have a supported video card.
    </para>

    <para>
      To check if DRI drivers are installed properly, check the log file
      <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> for statements such as:
    </para>

<screen><literal>(II) intel(0): direct rendering: DRI2 Enabled</literal></screen>

    <para>or</para>

<screen><literal>(II) NOUVEAU(0): Loaded DRI module</literal></screen>

    <note>
      <para>
        DRI configuration may differ if you are using alternate drivers, such
        as those from
        <ulink url="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html">NVIDIA</ulink> or
        <ulink url="http://www.ati.com/">ATI</ulink>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Although all users can use software acceleration, any hardware acceleration (DRI2)
      is only available to <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and members
      of the <systemitem class="groupname">video</systemitem> group.
    </para>
<!--
    <para>
      To see if hardware acceleration is available for your driver, look in
      <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> for statements like:
    </para>

<screen><literal>(II) intel(0): direct rendering: DRI2 Enabled</literal></screen>
-->
    <para>
      If your driver is supported, add any users that might use X to that group:
    </para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>usermod -a -G video <replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Another way to determine if DRI is working properly is to use one of the
      two optionally installed OpenGL demo programs in <xref
      linkend="mesa"/>. From an X terminal, run <command>glxinfo</command>
      and look for the phrase:
    </para>

<screen><computeroutput>name of display: :0
display: :0  screen: 0
direct rendering: Yes</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>
      If direct rendering is enabled, you can add verbosity by running
      <command>LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo</command>. This will show the drivers,
      device nodes and files used by the DRI system.
    </para>

    <para>
      To confirm that DRI2 hardware acceleration is working, you can (still in
      the X terminal) run the command <command>glxinfo | egrep "(OpenGL
      vendor|OpenGL renderer|OpenGL version)"</command>.
      If that reports something <emphasis>other than</emphasis>
      <literal>Software Rasterizer</literal> then you have working
      acceleration for the user who ran the command.
    </para>

    <para>
      If your hardware does not have any DRI2 driver available, it will use a
      Software Rasterizer for Direct Rendering. In such cases, you can use a new,
      LLVM-accelerated, Software Rasterizer called LLVMPipe. In order to build
      LLVMPipe just make sure that <xref linkend="llvm"/> is present at Mesa
      build time. Note that all decoding is done on the CPU instead of the GPU,
      so the display will run slower than with hardware acceleration.
      To check if you are using LLVMpipe,
      review the output ot the glxinfo command above.  An example of the
      output using the Software Rasterizer is shown below:
    </para>

<screen><computeroutput>OpenGL vendor string: VMware, Inc.
OpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.5, 256 bits)
OpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 10.4.5</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>
      You can also force LLVMPipe by exporting the <envar>LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1</envar>
      environment variable when starting Xorg.
    </para>

    <para>
      Again, if you have built the Mesa OpenGL demos, you can also run the test
      program <command>glxgears</command>. This program brings up a window with
      three gears turning. The X terminal will display how many frames were
      drawn every five seconds, so this will give a rough benchmark. The window
      is scalable, and the frames drawn per second is highly dependent on the
      size of the window. On some hardware, <command>glxgears</command> will
      run synchronized with the vertical refresh signal and the frame rate will
      be approximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.
    </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 role="configuration" id="hybrid-graphics" xreflabel="Hybrid Graphics">
    <title>Hybrid Graphics</title>

    <para>
      Hybrid Graphics is still in experimental state for Linux. Xorg Developers have
      developed a technology called PRIME that can be used for switching between
      integrated and muxless discrete GPU at will. Automatic switching is not
      possible at the moment.
    </para>

    <para>
      In order to use PRIME for GPU switching, make sure that you are using Linux
      Kernel 3.4 or later (recommended). You will need latest DRI and DDX drivers
      for your hardware and <application>Xorg Server</application> 1.13 or later
      with an optional patch applied.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>Xorg Server</application> should load both GPU drivers automaticaly.
      In order to run a GLX application on a discrete GPU, you will need to export
      the <envar>DRI_PRIME=1</envar> environment variable. For example,

<screen><userinput>DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | egrep "(OpenGL vendor|OpenGL renderer|OpenGL version)"</userinput></screen>

      will show OpenGL vendor, renderer and version for the discrete GPU.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the last command reports same OpenGL renderer with and without
      <envar>DRI_PRIME=1</envar>, you will need to check your installation.
    </para>

    <sect2 role="configuration" id="xft-font-protocol"  xreflabel="Xft Font Protocol">
      <title>Xft Font Protocol</title>

      <indexterm zone="xft-font-protocol" id="fonts">
        <primary sortas="g-truetype">TrueType Fonts</primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>Xft provides antialiased font rendering through
      <application>Freetype</application>, and fonts are controlled from the
      client side using <application>Fontconfig</application>.  The default
      search path is <filename class="directory">/usr/share/fonts</filename>
      and <filename class="directory">~/.fonts</filename>.
      <application>Fontconfig</application> searches directories in its
      path recursively and maintains a cache of the font characteristics in
      <filename>fonts.cache-1</filename> files in each directory.  If the cache
      appears to be out of date, it is ignored, and information is (slowly)
      fetched from the fonts themselves.  This cache
      can be regenerated using the <command>fc-cache</command> command at any
      time. You can see the list of fonts known by
      <application>Fontconfig</application> by running the command
      <command>fc-list</command>.</para>

      <para>If you've installed <application>Xorg</application> in any prefix
      other than <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>, the
      <application>X</application> fonts were not installed in a
      location known to <application>Fontconfig</application>. This prevents
      <application>Fontconfig</application> from using the poorly rendered
      Type 1 fonts or the non-scalable bitmapped fonts. Symlinks were created
      from the <filename class="directory">OTF</filename> and <filename
      class="directory">TTF</filename> <application>X</application> font
      directories to <filename
      class="directory">/usr/share/fonts/X11-{OTF,TTF}</filename>. This allows
      <application>Fontconfig</application> to use the OpenType and TrueType
      fonts provided by <application>X</application> (which are scalable and
      of higher quality).</para>

      <para><application>Fontconfig</application> uses names such as
      "Monospace 12" to define fonts.  Applications generally use generic font
      names such as "Monospace", "Sans" and "Serif".
      <application>Fontconfig</application> resolves these names to a font that
      has all characters that cover the orthography of the language indicated
      by the locale settings.  Knowledge of these font names is included in
      <filename>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</filename>. Fonts that are not listed
      in this file are still usable by <application>Fontconfig</application>,
      but they will not be accessible by the generic family names.</para>

      <para>Standard scalable fonts that come with <application>X</application>
      provide very poor Unicode coverage.  You may notice in applications that
      use <application>Xft</application> that some characters appear as a box
      with four binary digits inside.  In this case, a font set with the
      available glyphs has not been found.  Other times, applications that
      don't use other font families by default and don't accept substitutions
      from <application>Fontconfig</application> will display blank lines when
      the default font doesn't cover the orthography of the user's language.
      This happens, e.g., with <application>Fluxbox</application> in the
      ru_RU.KOI8-R locale.</para>

      <para>In order to provide greater Unicode coverage, it is recommended
      that you install these fonts:</para>

      <para>The list above will not provide complete Unicode coverage.
      Unicode is updated every year, and most additions are now for historic
      writing systems. For almost-complete coverage you can install <xref
      linkend="noto-fonts"/> (about 180 fonts when last checked) but that
      number of fonts makes it <emphasis>much</emphasis> less convenient to
      select a specific font in a document, and most people will regard many
      of them as a waste of space. We used to recommend the <ulink

      <para>As a font installation example, consider the installation of the
      DejaVu fonts. In this particular package, the TTF files are in a
      subdirectory. From the unpacked source directory, run the following
      commands as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;

fc-cache -v /usr/share/fonts/dejavu</userinput></screen>

      <para>Fonts are often supplied in zip files, requiring <xref linkend="unzip"/>
      to list and extract them, but even if the current release is a tarball
      you should still check to see if it will create a directory.</para>

  <sect2 role="configuration" id='xconfig'>
    <title>Setting up Xorg Devices</title>

    <para>For most hardware configurations, modern Xorg will automatically
    get the server configuration correct without any user intervention. There
    are, however, some cases where auto-configuration will be incorrect.
    Following are some example manual configuration items that may be of use in
    these instances.</para>

    <sect3 id="xinput">
    <title>Setting up X Input Devices</title>
    <para>For most input devices, no additional configuration will be
    necessary.  This section is provided for informational purposes only.</para>

    <para>A sample default XKB setup could look like the following (executed as
    the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user):</para>

<screen><userinput role="username">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xkb-defaults.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"

EndSection
EOF</userinput></screen>

  </sect3>

  <sect3 id="xdisplay">
  <title>Fine Tuning Display Settings</title>

  <para>Again, with modern Xorg, little or no additional configuration is
  necessary. If you should need extra options passed to your video driver,
  for instance, you could use something like the following (again, executed as
  the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user):</para>

<screen><userinput role="root">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/videocard-0.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"

  <para>Another common setup is having multiple server layouts for use in
