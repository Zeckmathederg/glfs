    <para>To test the <application>Xorg</application> installation, issue
    <userinput>startx</userinput>.  This command brings up a rudimentary window
    manager called <emphasis>twm</emphasis> with three xterm windows and one
    xclock window.  The xterm window in the upper left is a login terminal and
    running <emphasis>exit</emphasis> from this terminal will exit the
    <application>X Window</application> session.  The third xterm window may be
    obscured on your system by the other two xterms.</para>
    
    <para>Generally, there is no specific configuration required for
    <application>Xorg</application>, but customization is possible.  For details

    <title>Checking the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) Installation</title>

    <para>DRI is a framework for allowing software to access graphics hardware
    in a safe and efficient manner. It is installed in <application>X</application>
    by default (using <application>MesaLib</application>) if you have a supported
    video card.</para>

    <para>To check if DRI is installed properly, check the log file
    <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> for statements like:</para>

<screen><literal>(II) R128(0): Direct rendering enabled</literal></screen>

    <note><para>DRI configuration may differ if you are using alternate
    drivers, such as those from
    <ulink url="http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html">NVIDIA</ulink> or
    <ulink url="http://www.ati.com/">ATI</ulink>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Although all users can use software acceleration, any hardware
    acceleration (DRI2) is only available to
    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and members of the
    <systemitem class="groupname">video</systemitem> group.</para>

    <para>To see if hardware acceleration is available for your driver, look in
    <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> for statements like:</para>

<screen><literal> (II) intel(0): direct rendering: DRI2 Enabled</literal></screen>

    <para>If your driver is supported, add any users that might use X to that group:</para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>usermod -a -G video <replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>If you elected to install the Mesa-Demos package when installing
    <xref linkend="mesalib"/>, from an <command>xterm</command>, run
    <command>glxinfo</command> and first look for the phrase:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>direct rendering: Yes</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>If direct rendering is enabled, you can add verbosity by
    running <command>LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo</command>.  This will
    show the drivers, device nodes and files used by the DRI system.</para>

    <para>If DRI is enabled, to confirm that DRI2 hardware acceleration is
    working you can (still in the <command>xterm</command>) run the command
    <command>glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer string"</command> - if that
    reports something <emphasis>other than</emphasis>
    <literal>Software Rasterizer</literal> then you have working acceleration
    for the user who ran the command.</para>

    <para>Again, if you have added the Mesa-Demos package, you can also
    run the test program <command>glxgears</command>.
    This program brings up a window with three gears turning.  The
    <command>xterm</command> will display how many frames were drawn every
    five seconds, so this is a reasonable benchmark.  The window is scalable,
    and the frames drawn per second is highly dependent on the size of
    the window.</para>

    <title>Creating an X11R6 Compatibility Symlink</title>

    <para>Until recently (relatively speaking) almost every
    <application>X Window</application> installation you performed or came
    across was installed in the
    <filename class='directory'>/usr/X11R6</filename> directory. That was the
    standard for years. Developers picked up on this and wrote their package
    installation scripts looking for <application>X</application> in the
    standard location. Things have changed and the trend is to now install
    <application>X</application> in
    <filename class='directory'>/usr</filename>. Some people want to install
    it in a custom location.</para>

    <para>Many package developers have not caught up to the change and their
    packages are still trying to find <application>X</application> in
    <filename class='directory'>/usr/X11R6</filename> and subsequently fail
    when you try to build the package. Though for most packages it is not
    difficult to 'hack' the installation script to fix the problem, that is not
    the long term solution to the problem. Upstream developers need to modernize
    their installation scripts and eliminate the problem altogether.</para>

    <para>Until then, you can create a symbolic link to satisfy the
    <filename class='directory'>/usr/X11R6</filename> requirement so that you
    won't be inconvenienced with a package build failure due to this known
    issue. If you wish to create the symlink, issue the following command as
    the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

    <sect2 role="configuration" id="xft-font-protocol"  xreflabel="Xft Font Protocol">
      <title>Xft Font Protocol</title>

      <!-- there is no #label in the html to which this index can link -->
      <!-- renamed to -zztruetype instead of -truetype so that it sorts last. -->

      </indexterm>

      <para>Xft provides antialiased font rendering through
      <application>Freetype</application>, and fonts are controlled from the
      client side using <application>Fontconfig</application>.  The default
      search path is <filename class="directory">/usr/share/fonts</filename>
      and <filename class="directory">~/.fonts</filename>.
      <application>Fontconfig</application> searches directories in its
      path recursively and maintains a cache of the font characteristics in
      <filename>fonts.cache-1</filename> files in each directory.  If the cache
      appears to be out of date, it is ignored, and information is (slowly)
      fetched from the fonts themselves.  This cache
      can be regenerated using the <command>fc-cache</command> command at any
      time. You can see the list of fonts known by
      <application>Fontconfig</application> by running the command
      <command>fc-list</command>.</para>

      <para>If you've installed <application>Xorg</application> in any prefix
      other than <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>, the
      <application>X</application> fonts were not installed in a
      location known to <application>Fontconfig</application>. This prevents
      <application>Fontconfig</application> from using the poorly rendered
      Type 1 fonts or the non-scalable bitmapped fonts. Symlinks were created
      from the <filename class="directory">OTF</filename> and <filename
      class="directory">TTF</filename> <application>X</application> font
      directories to <filename
      class="directory">/usr/share/fonts/X11-{OTF,TTF}</filename>. This allows
      <application>Fontconfig</application> to use the OpenType and TrueType
      fonts provided by <application>X</application> (which are scalable and
      of higher quality).</para>

      <para><application>Fontconfig</application> uses names such as
      "Monospace 12" to define fonts.  Applications generally use generic font
      names such as "Monospace", "Sans" and "Serif".
      <application>Fontconfig</application> resolves these names to a font that
      has all characters that cover the orthography of the language indicated
      by the locale settings.  Knowledge of these font names is included in
      <filename>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</filename>. Fonts that are not listed
      in this file are still usable by <application>Fontconfig</application>,
      but they will not be accessible by the generic family names.</para>

      <para>Standard scalable fonts that come with <application>X</application>
      provide very poor Unicode coverage.  You may notice in applications that
      use <application>Xft</application> that some characters appear as a box
      with four binary digits inside.  In this case, a font set with the
      available glyphs has not been found.  Other times, applications that
      don't use other font families by default and don't accept substitutions
      from <application>Fontconfig</application> will display blank lines when
      the default font doesn't cover the orthography of the user's language.
      This happens, e.g., with <application>Fluxbox</application> in the
      ru_RU.KOI8-R locale.</para>

      <para>In order to provide greater Unicode coverage, it is recommended
      that you install these fonts:</para>

  <sect2 role="configuration" id='xconfig'>
    <title>Setting up Xorg Devices</title>
    <para>For most hardware configurations, modern Xorg will automatically
    get the server configuration correct without any user intervention. There
    are, however, some cases where auto-configuration will be incorrect.
    Following are some example manual configuration items that may be of use in
    these instances.</para>

    <sect3 id="xinput">
    <title>Setting up X Input Devices</title>
    <para>For most input devices, no additional configuration will be
    necessary.  This section is provided for informational purposes only.</para>
    
    <para>A sample default XKB setup could look like the following (executed as
    the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user):</para>
<screen><userinput role="username">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/xkb-defaults.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "XKB Defaults"
    MatchIsKeyboard "yes"
    Option "XkbOptions" "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
EOF</userinput></screen>

  </sect3>

  <sect3 id="xdisplay">
  <title>Fine Tuning Display Settings</title>
  <para>Again, with modern Xorg, little or no additional configuration is
  necessary. If you should need extra options passed to your video driver,
  for instance, you could use something like the following (again, executed as
  the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user):</para>

<screen><userinput role="root">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/videocard-0.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Videocard0"
    Driver      "radeon"

    BoardName   "ATI Radeon 7500"
    Option      "NoAccel" "true"
EndSection
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>Another common setup is having multiple server layouts for use in
  different environments. Though the server will automatically detect the
  presence of another monitor, it may get the order incorrect:</para>

<screen><userinput role="root">cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/server-layout.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier     "DefaultLayout"
