        Before starting Xorg for the first time, is is often needed to
        reboot the system to ensure all appropriate daemons are started
        and appropriate security issues are properly set.

      <para>
        If Xorg hangs for some reason (for example, lacking a proper
        input driver), the system may stop responding to any user input.
        As a precaution, you can enable a magic <keycap>SysRq</keycap> key
        before testing Xorg.  As the
        <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user, issue:

      To test the <application>Xorg</application> installation, issue
      <command>startx</command>. This command brings up a rudimentary window
      manager called <emphasis>twm</emphasis> with three xterm windows and one
      xclock window.  The xterm window in the upper left is a login terminal and
      running <emphasis>exit</emphasis> from this terminal will exit the

      <para>
        When testing <application>Xorg</application> with the

        $HOME/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log<!--</filename>-->, about missing font
        files. In addition, there will be several warnings on the text mode
        terminal (usually tty1) about missing fonts. These warnings do not
        affect functionality, but can be removed if desired by installing
        the <xref linkend="xorg7-legacy"/>.

    <para>
      DRI is a framework for allowing software to access graphics hardware in
      a safe and efficient manner. It is installed in
      <application>X</application> by default (using
      <application>Mesa</application>) if you have a supported video card.
    </para>

    <para>
      To check if DRI drivers are installed properly, check the log file
      <filename>$HOME/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log</filename> (or
      <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> if you have
      built <xref linkend="xorg-server"/> with the suid bit) for
      statements such as:

    <note>
      <para>
        DRI configuration may differ if you are using alternate drivers, such
        as traditional DDX drivers, or the proprietary drivers from

<!-- With elogind, this is not needed anymore
    <para>
      Although all users can use software acceleration, any hardware
      acceleration (DRI2) is only available to <systemitem
      class="username">root</systemitem> and members of the <systemitem

-->
    <para>
      Another way to determine if DRI is working properly is to use one of the
      two optionally installed OpenGL demo programs in <xref
      linkend="mesa"/>. From an X terminal, run <command>glxinfo</command>
      and look for the phrase:
    </para>

<screen><computeroutput>name of display: :0
display: :0  screen: 0
direct rendering: Yes</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>
      If direct rendering is enabled, you can add verbosity by running
      <command>LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose glxinfo</command>. This will show the
      drivers, device nodes and files used by the DRI system.
    </para>

    <para>
      To confirm that DRI2 hardware acceleration is working, you can (still in
      the X terminal) run the command <command>glxinfo | grep -E "(OpenGL
      vendor|OpenGL renderer|OpenGL version)"</command>.
      If that reports something <emphasis>other than</emphasis>
      <literal>Software Rasterizer</literal> then you have working
      acceleration for the user who ran the command.
    </para>

    <para>
      If your hardware does not have any DRI2 driver available, it will use a
      Software Rasterizer for Direct Rendering. In such cases, you can use a
      new, LLVM-accelerated, Software Rasterizer called LLVMPipe. In order to
      build LLVMPipe just make sure that <xref linkend="llvm"/> is present at
      Mesa build time. Note that all decoding is done on the CPU instead of
      the GPU, so the display will run slower than with hardware acceleration.
      To check if you are using LLVMpipe, review the output of the glxinfo
      command above.  An example of the output using the Software Rasterizer
      is shown below:
    </para>

<screen><computeroutput>OpenGL vendor string: VMware, Inc.
OpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.5, 256 bits)
OpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 10.4.5</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>
      You can also force LLVMPipe by exporting the
      <envar>LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1</envar> environment variable when
      starting Xorg.
    </para>

    <para>
      Again, if you have built the Mesa OpenGL demos, you can also run the test
      program <command>glxgears</command>. This program brings up a window with
      three gears turning. The X terminal will display how many frames were
      drawn every five seconds, so this will give a rough benchmark. The window
      is scalable, and the frames drawn per second is highly dependent on the
      size of the window. On some hardware, <command>glxgears</command> will
      run synchronized with the vertical refresh signal and the frame rate will
      be approximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.
    </para>

  <sect2 role="configuration" id="xorg-debug" xreflabel="Debugging Xorg">
    <title>Debugging Xorg</title>

    <para>
      When starting xorg, there are a couple of ways to check what any
      issues you may have.  If the system comes up, you can see what driver
      is being used by running <command>xdriinfo</command>. If there are
      issues or you just want to check, look at <filename>Xorg.0.log</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The location of <filename>Xorg.0.log</filename> depends on how Xorg is
      installed.  If the instructions in the book are followed closely and
      Xorg is started from the command line, it will be located in the
      <filename class="directory">$HOME/.local/share/xorg/</filename> directory.
      If Xorg is started by a display manager (e.g. <xref linkend='lightdm'/>,
      <xref linkend='lxdm'/>, or <xref linkend='gdm'/>) or if
      <filename>$XORG_PREFIX/bin/Xorg</filename> has the suid bit set,
      it will be located in the <filename class="directory">/var/log/</filename>
      directory.
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect3">Xorg.0.log Issues</bridgehead>

    <para>
      When you look at Xorg.0.log, check for entries like (EE) or (WW).
      Below are some common entries:
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">(WW) Open ACPI failed (/var/run/acpid.socket)</bridgehead>

    <para>
      This warning is because <xref linkend='acpid'/> is not installed. If you
      are not on a laptop, it can be safely ignored. On a laptop, install
      <xref linkend='acpid'/> to enable actions like recognizing when the lid is
      closed.
    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect5">(WW) VGA arbiter: cannot open kernel arbiter, no multi-card support</bridgehead>

    <para>
      This warning is displayed when a regular user starts Xorg.  The library
      <filename>libpciaccess.so</filename> issues this warning when it
      tries to open <filename>/dev/vga_arbiter</filename>.  If there is no
      more than one legacy PCI (not PCIe) graphic cards on the system, it
      can safely be ignored.  If really necessary, the
      permissions of this device can be changed by adding a udev rule and
      adding the local user to the video group. As the &root; user:

  <sect2 role="configuration" id="hybrid-graphics" xreflabel="Hybrid Graphics">
    <title>Hybrid Graphics</title>

    <para>
      Hybrid Graphics is still in experimental state for Linux. Xorg Developers
      have developed a technology called PRIME that can be used for switching
      between integrated and muxless discrete GPU at will. Automatic switching
      is not possible at the moment.
    </para>

    <para>
      In order to use PRIME for GPU switching, make sure that you are using
      Linux Kernel 3.4 or later (recommended). You will need latest DRI and
      DDX drivers for your hardware and <application>Xorg Server</application>
      1.13 or later.
    </para>

    <para>
      <application>Xorg Server</application> should load both GPU drivers
      automatically. You can check that by running:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>xrandr --listproviders</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      There should be two (or more) providers listed, for example:
    </para>

<screen><computeroutput>Providers: number : 2
Provider 0: id: 0x7d cap: 0xb, Source Output, Sink Output, Sink Offload crtcs: 3 outputs: 4 associated providers: 1 name:modesetting
Provider 1: id: 0x56 cap: 0xf, Source Output, Sink Output, Source Offload, Sink Offload crtcs: 6 outputs: 1 associated providers: 1 name:modesetting</computeroutput></screen>

    <!-- Well, both "id" and "name" are supposed to work here but after
         the xf86-video-* removal all the names will be modesetting unless
         a proprietary driver used... -->
    <para>
      In order to be able to run a GLX application on a discrete GPU, you will
      need to run the following command, where &lt;provider&gt; is the id of
      the more powerful discrete card, and &lt;sink&gt; is the id of card
      which has a display connected:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink <replaceable>&lt;provider&gt; &lt;sink&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>
        With the <application>Xorg</application> modesetting driver,
        which is DRI3 capable, the above command is no longer
        necessary. It does no harm however.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Then, you will need to export the <envar>DRI_PRIME=1</envar> environment
      variable each time you want the powerful GPU to be used. For example,

<screen><userinput>DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo | grep -E "(OpenGL vendor|OpenGL renderer|OpenGL version)"</userinput></screen>

      will show OpenGL vendor, renderer and version for the discrete GPU.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the last command reports same OpenGL renderer with and without
      <envar>DRI_PRIME=1</envar>, you will need to check your installation.

        From the output we can see the monitor is identified
        <literal>DP-1</literal>.  Select a suitable resolution from the
        output list, for example <literal>1920x1440</literal>.  Then
        as the &root; user, create a configuration file for the Xorg server:

      <para>
        Sometimes <command>xrandr</command> may fail to detect some
        resolution settings supported by the monitor.  It usually happens
        with virtual monitors of virtual machine managers like
        <xref linkend='qemu'/> or VMWare: a virtual monitor actually
        supports all pairs of integers in a range as the resolution, but
        <command>xrandr</command> will only list a few.  To use a
        resolution not listed by <command>xrandr</command>, first run
        <command>cvt</command> to get the mode line for the resolution.
        For example:

      <para>
        Some high-end LCD monitors support a refresh rate higher than 100 Hz
        but <command>xrandr</command> may fail to recognize the supported

        from utilizing the full capability of the monitor, and may cause
        the screen to flicker or show <quote>artifacts</quote> like meshes
        or grids.  To resolve the issue, again use <command>cvt</command>
        to get the mode line with a custom refresh rate:
