    <title>About TTF and OTF fonts</title>

    <para>
      Originally, Xorg provided only bitmap fonts. Later, some scalable
      Type1 fonts were added, but the desktop world moved on to using TrueType
      and Open Type fonts. To support these, Xorg uses Xft, the X FreeType
      interface library.
    </para>

    <para>
      These fonts can provide hints, which <application>fontconfig</application>
      uses to adjust them for maximum readability on computer monitors. On linux
      you should always prefer the hinted versions, if available (in general the
      latin, cyrillic and greek alphabets can use hints, most other writing
      systems do not use hinting).
    </para>

    <para>
      A few fonts are provided as collections (TTC or OTC) where font data
      is shared between different fonts, thus saving disk space. Treat these in
      exactly the same way as individual TTF or OTF files.
    </para>

    <para>
      If a font provides both TTF and OTF forms, prefer the OTF form in
      linux, it may provide more features for programs which know how to use them
      (such as xelatex).
    </para>

    <para>
      For some scripts <application>pango</application> is required to
      render things correctly, either by selecting different glyph forms, or by
      combining glyphs - in both cases, according to the context. This applies
      particularly to arabic and indic scripts.
    </para>

    <para>
      Standard scalable fonts that come with <application>X</application>
      provide very poor Unicode coverage.  You may notice in applications that
      use <application>Xft</application> that some characters appear as a box
      with four binary digits inside.  In this case, a font with the
      required glyphs has not been found.  Other times, applications that
      don't use other font families by default and don't accept substitutions
      from <application>Fontconfig</application> will display blank lines when
      the default font doesn't cover the orthography of the user's language.
    </para>

    <para>
      The fonts available to a program are those which were present when
      it was started, so if you add an extra font and wish to use it in a program
      which is currently running, then you will have to close and restart that
      program.
    </para>

    <para>
      Some people are happy to have dozens, or even hundreds, of font files
      available, but if you ever wish to select a specific font in a desktop
      application (for example in a word processor) then scrolling through a lot of
      fonts to find the right one is slow and awkward - fewer is better. So, for
      some font packages you might decide to install only one of the fonts - but
      nevertheless install the different variants (italic, bold, etc) as these are
      all variations for the same font name.
    </para>

    <para>
      In the past, everybody recommended running <command>fc-cache</command>
      as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user after installing
      or removing fonts, but this is no-longer necessary on linux,
      <application>fontconfig</application> will do it automatically if needed and
      if its caches are more than 30 seconds old. But if you add a font and want to
      immediately use it then you can run that command (as a normal user).
    </para>

    <para>
      There are several references below to CJK characters. This stands for
      Chinese, Japanese and Korean, although modern Korean is now almost all
      written using the phonetic Hangul glyphs (it used to sometimes use Hanja
      glyphs which are similar to Chinese and Japanese). Unicode decided to go
      for <ulink
      url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification">Han Unification</ulink>
      and to map some Chinese and Japanese glyphs to the same codepoints. This
      was very unpopular in Japan, and the result is that different fonts will
      render some codepoints in quite different shapes. In addition, Simplified
      Chinese will sometimes use the same codepoint as Traditional Chinese but
      will show it differently, somewhat analogous to the different shapes used
      for the letters 'a' and 'g' in English (single-storey and two-storey),
      except that in a language context one will look "wrong" rather than just
      "different".
    </para>

    <para>
      Unlike most other packages in this book, the BLFS editors do not
      monitor the versions of the fonts on this page - once a font is good enough
      for general use, the typical additions in a new version are minor (e.g. new
      currency symbols, or glyphs not for a modern language, such as emojis or
      playing cards). Therefore, none of these fonts show version or md5
      information.
    </para>

    <para>
      The list below will not provide complete Unicode coverage.
      Unicode is updated every year, and most additions are now for historic
      writing systems. For almost-complete coverage you can install <xref
      linkend="noto-fonts"/> (about 180 fonts when last checked) but that
      number of fonts makes it <emphasis>much</emphasis> less convenient to
      select a specific font in a document, and most people will regard many
      of them as a waste of space. We used to recommend the <ulink
      url="http://unifont.org/fontguide/">Unicode Font Guide</ulink>, but that
      has not been updated since 2008 and many of its links are dead.
    </para>

    <para>
      Rendered examples of most of these fonts, and many others, with
      details of what languages they cover, some examples of latin fonts with
      the same metrics (listed as "Substitute latin fonts") and various files
      of dummy text to compare fonts of similar types, can be found at this
      <ulink url="http://zarniwhoop.uk/ttf-otf-notes.html#examples">
      font comparison</ulink> page. That site also covers other current
      writing systems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Fonts are often supplied in zip files, requiring <xref linkend="unzip"/>
      to list and extract them, but even if the current release is a tarball
      you should still check to see if it will create a directory (scatterring
      the contents of a zipfile or tarball across the current directory can be
      very messy, and a few fonts create odd __MACOSX/ directories. In addition,
      many fonts are supplied with permissions which do not let 'other' read
      them - if a font is to be installed for system-wide use, any directories
      must be mode 755 and all the files mode 644, so change them if necessary.
      If you forget, the root user may be  able to see a particular font in
      <command>fc-list</command> but a normal user will not.
    </para>

    <para>
      As a font installation example, consider the installation of the
      <xref linkend="dejavu-fonts"/>. In this particular package, the TTF files
      are in a subdirectory. From the unpacked source directory, run the
      following commands as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      user:
    </para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
install -v -m644 ttf/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
fc-cache -v /usr/share/fonts/dejavu</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      If you wish, you can also install any licenses or other documentation,
      either alongside the font or in a corresponding directory under
      <filename class="directory">/usr/share/doc/</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      A few fonts ship with source as well as with the completed TTF or OTF
      file(s). Unless you intend to modify the font, and have the correct tools
      (sometimes <xref linkend="fontforge"/>, but often commercial tools), the
      source will provide no benefit, so do not install it. One or two fonts even
      ship with Web Open Font Format (WOFF) files - useful if you run a webserver
      and want to use that font on it, but not useful for desktops.
    </para>

    <para>
      To provide greater Unicode coverage, you are recommended to install
      some of the following fonts, depending on what webistes and languages you
      wish to read.  The next part of this page details some fonts which cover
      at least latin alphabets, the final part deals with come CJK issues.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        You are strongly recommended to install the <xref
        linkend="dejavu-fonts"/>.

      fonts which are comparatively large) and rather light weight ("less black"
      when black on white is used) which means that in some contexts such as
      terminals they are not visually pleasing, for example when most other

    <para>The <ulink url="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">Microsoft Core
       fonts</ulink> date from 2002. They were supplied with old versions of

       You can extract them from the 'exe' files using
       <application>bsd-tar</application> from <xref linkend="libarchive"/>.
       Be sure to read the license before using them. At one time some of
       these fonts (particularly Arial, Times New Roman, and to a lesser
       extent Courier New) were widely specified on web pages. The full set

    <para>
      Although many old posts recommend installing these fonts for

    <para>
      The <ulink
      url="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto fonts</ulink> ('No Tofu', i.e.
      avoiding boxes with dots [hex digits] when a glyph cannot be found) is a
      set of fonts which aim to cover <emphasis>every glyph in unicode, no
      matter how obscure</emphasis>. These fonts, or at least the Sans Serif
      fonts, are used by KF5 (initially only for gtk applications). If you want
      to cover historic languages, you can download all the fonts by clicking
      on the link at the top of that page.
    </para>

    <para>
      People using languages written in Latin, Greek or Cyrillic alphabets need
      only install Noto Sans itself, and perhaps Noto Sans Symbols for currency
      symbols. For more details on the CJK fonts see <xref
      linkend="NotoSansCJK"/> below. There are also separate fonts for every
      other current writing system, but these too will also require Noto Sans
      (or Noto Serif) and perhaps Noto Symbols.
    </para>

    <para>
      However, you should be aware that <application>fontconfig</application>
      knows nothing about Noto fonts. The 'Noto Sans Something' fonts are each
      treated as separate fonts (and for Arabic there is not a specifically Sans
      name), so if you have other fonts installed then the choice of which font
      to use for missing glyphs where 'Noto Sans' is specified will be random,
      except that Sans fonts will be preferred over <emphasis>known</emphasis>
      Serif and Monospace fonts because Sans is the fallback for unknown fonts.

      which were designed for integrated use with the KDE desktop. Those fonts
      are no-longer actively maintained, so KDE made a decision to switch to
      <xref linkend="noto-fonts"/>, but for the moment they are still
      <emphasis>required</emphasis> by 'startkde'.
    </para>

    <para>
      Originally these fonts were only supplied as source, needing <xref
      linkend="cmake"/> and <xref linkend="fontforge"/> to create the TTF
      files. But for a while the source has also included the prepared TTF.
      The only unusual feature is that each TTF file is in its own subdirectory
      (<filename class="directory">oxygen-fonts/{*-?00}/</filename>) with the
      source in further subdirectories. You could just install the whole
      tarball if you prefer, although that will waste space.

    xreflabel="CJKfonts">CJK fonts:</bridgehead>

    <para>
      As indicated earlier, usage of a combination of Chinese, Japanese
      and Korean can be tricky - each font only covers a subset of the available
      codepoints, the preferred shapes of the glyphs can differ between the
      languages, and many of the CJK fonts do not actually support modern
      Korean.
    </para>

    <para>
      Also, by default <application>fontconfig</application> prefers Chinese to
      Japanese. Tuning that is covered at <xref
      linkend="prefer-chosen-CJK-fonts"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Although Unicode has been extended to allow a very large number of CJK
      codepoints, those outside the Base Plane (greater than U+0xFFFF) are not
      commonly used in Mandarin (the normal form of written Chinese, whether
      Simplified (PRC) or Traditional (Taiwan)), or Japanese.
    </para>

    <para>
      For Hong Kong, which uses Traditional Chinese and where Cantonese is the
      dominant language, the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set was added to
      Unicode in 2005 and revised in 2009 (it is part of CJK Extension B and
      contains more than 1900 characters). Earlier fonts will not be able to
      support either Cantonese or use of these characters where local names are
      written in Mandarin. The UMing HK, Noto Sans CJK HK and WenQuanYi Zen Hei
      fonts all seem to cover Hong Kong usage
      (<application>fontconfig</application> disagrees about Noto Sans CJK HK).
    </para>

    <para>
      The Han glyphs are double-width, other glyphs in the same font may be
      narrower. For their CJK content, all of these fonts can be regarded as
      monospaced (i.e. fixed width).
    </para>

    <para>
      If all you wish to do is to be able to render CJK glyphs, installing

      looks quite different, and modern Hei ("sans"). Unless you appreciate the

        <ulink

        Zen Hei</ulink> provides a Sans-Serif font which covers all CJK scripts
        including Korean. Although it includes old-style conf files, these are
        not required: <application>fontconfig</application> will already treat
        these fonts (the 'sharp' contains bitmaps, the monospace appears not
        to be Mono in its ASCII part) as Sans, Serif, and Monospace. If all
        you wish to do is to be able to render Han and Korean text without
        worrying about the niceties of the shapes used, the main font from
        this package is a good font to use.

      <para>
        In Japanese, Gothic fonts are Sans, Mincho are Serif. BLFS used to
        only mention the Kochi fonts, but those appear to now be the
        least-preferred of the Japanese fonts.
      </para>

        Apart from the fonts detailed below, also consider <xref

      <para>
        The <ulink url="http://ipafont.ipa.go.jp/">IPAex fonts</ulink> are
        the current version of the IPA fonts. Click on 'English' at the link and
        then click on the Download icon to find IPAex Font Ver.003.01.
        Unfortunately, <application>fontconfig</application> only knows about
        the older IPAfonts and the forked IPA Mona font (which is not easily
        available and which apparently does not meet Debian's Free Software
        guidelines). Therefore if you install the IPAex fonts you may wish
        to make it known to fontconfig, see <xref
        linkend="prefer-chosen-CJK-fonts"/> for one possible way to do this.

    <para>
      In Korean, Batang or Myeongjo (the older name) are Serif, Dotum or
      Gothic are the main Sans fonts. BLFS previously recommended the Baekmuk
      fonts, but the Nanum and Un fonts are now preferred to Baekmuk by
      <application>fontconfig</application> because of user requests.
    </para>

    <!-- when testing, my previous Nanum link gave permission errors, so
    link to a general page, at the cost of making it more complicated to
    download -->

    <para>
      A convenient place to see examples of these and many other Korean
      fonts is <ulink url="http://www.freekoreanfont.com/">Free Korean
      Fonts</ulink>. Click on 'Gothic Fonts' or 'All Categories -> Myeongjo
      Fonts', then click on the font example to see more details including the
      License, and click on the link to download it. For Nanum, you will need
      to be able to read Korean to find the download link on the page you get
      to. For Un there are direct links and you can find the un-fonts-core
      tarball in the <filename class="directory">releases/</filename>
      directory.
