    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      Display Managers are graphical programs used for starting the graphical
      display (currently, the X server) and providing a login capability for
      a Window Manager or Desktop Environment.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are many Display Managers available. Some of the more well
      known include:
      <application>GDM</application>,
      <application>KDM</application> (deprecated),
      <application>LightDM</application>,
      <application>LXDM</application>,
      <application>Slim</application>, and
      <application>SDDM</application>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Among the Desktop Environments available for Linux you find:
      <application>Enlightenment</application>,
      <application>GNOME</application>,
      <application>KDE</application>,
      <application>LXDE</application>,
      <application>LXQt</application>, and
      <application>XFce</application>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Choosing a Display Manager or Desktop Environment is highly subjective.
      The choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the resources
      (memory and disk space) required, and the utilities included.
    </para>

    <para>
      In this chapter, the installation instructions of some Display Managers
      are presented. Later in the book, you will find other ones, which are
      provided as part of some Desktop Environments.
