    <para>
      <application>QtWebEngine</application> integrates
      <application>chromium</application>'s web capabilities into Qt. It
      ships with its own copy of ninja which it uses for the build if it cannot
      find a system copy, and various copies of libraries from ffmpeg, icu,
      libvpx, and zlib (including libminizip) which have been forked by the
      <application>chromium</application> developers.
    </para>

    <para>
      This package and browsers using it may be useful if you need to use a
      website designed for google chrome, or chromium, browsers.
    </para>

    <!-- Note for editors re switching between git versions and releases:
      If a public release of Qt 5.15.3 (or later) appears in a meaningful
      time frame, please keep the notes re the git build, as comments, so
      that updating for later fixes will be easier: in the past, updates
      of 'stable' versions (i.e. 5.12 when 5.14, 5.15 were the newest)
      happened much later than updates to the newest version (now Qt6)
      and it seems likely we might again need to use a git version to fix
      future chromium vulnerabilities. -->

    <warning>
      <para>
        QtWebEngine uses a forked copy of chromium, and is therefore vulnerable
        to many issues found there. The Qt developers have always preferred to
        make releases at the same time as the rest of Qt (rather than adding
        emergency fixes), but with stable versions getting released after the
        current development version. Now that they are keen to move to Qt6, the
        5.15.3 and later Qt-5.15 releases are initially only available to paying
        customers. QtWebEngine is something of an exception because of its LGPL
        licence, but getting the git sources (with the forked chromium submodule)
        to a position where they will successfully build on a current BLFS system
        can take a lot of effort and therefore updates to the book may be delayed.
      </para>

      <para>
        It seems likely that future 5.15-series versions will also be released
        long after the chromium vulnerabilities are known, but fixes for
        QtWebEngine can be found in git and the editors take the view that
        known vulnerabilities in browsers should be fixed.
      </para>

      <para> <!-- for git versions -->
        The tarball linked to below was created from the 5.15.6 git branch
        and the 87-branch of the chromium submodule (which is forked from
        chromium). See the GIT-VERSIONS file in the tarball (after applying
        any patches) for details of the latest commits.
      </para>
    </warning>

    <!-- note for editors on obtaining webengine from git.
      First (if you do not already have a past version)
      git clone git://code.qt.io/qt/qtwebengine.git
      git submodule init -
       that will report qtwebengine-chromium.git registered for src/3rdparty
       now find the main branch names:
      git fetch origin
      git branch -r
       after a release is prepared (even if the rest is not public), the 5.15
       branch now seems to get updated and might be what you want. But in the
       approach to 5.15.6 the backported CVE and other security fixes were only
       applied to 5.15.6.  So, assuming that a 5.15.7 branch now exists,
      git checkout origin/5.15.7
       Confirm that HEAD is where you expected.
       Now go to src/3rdparty
      git fetch origin
      git branch -r
       The required branch is likely to be 87-branch unless there is a newer one
      mentioned in the 5.15 cgit web page (below).
      git checkout origin/87-branch (or whatever)
       Use git log or git tk to look at its HEAD and check it seems appropriate.

      To decide when it might be worth creating a new tarball, periodically keep
      an eye on https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtwebengine.git/ (currently, the 5.15.6
      branch, 5.15.7 might get used later). The interesting items are CVE fixes
      for known chromium vulnerabilities, as well as numbered Security bugs -
      again, these relate to chromium.

      When I noticed some updates in late March I was searching for one of the
      CVEs mentioned, and google found a link to a review page for Michael Brüning
      at https://codereview.qt.nokia.com/q/owner:michael.bruning%2540qt.io. At that
      time I could see various unmerged items, so I waited. The items for the
      90-based chromium module are not relevant to 5.15-series (possibly they will
      be for qtwebengine-6+). Review queues for other Qt employees might be found
      in a similar way, but remember that everythng EXCEPT qtwebengine and chromium
      is private to Qt until they choose to release it.

      NOTE: the 3rdparty/chromium tree may contain more patches than have been
      merged into the current 5.15.x branch. Any patches after what was in the
      last 'update chromium' merge in qtwebengine occasionally break the build.

      After merging the contents of the qtwebengine and src/3rdparty git extracts,
      in the top level please create a GIT-VERSIONS file summarising the HEAD
      commits of both parts, as a reminder of where we are up to. I've nove added
      a CVE-fixes to keep track of what has been fixed (comits before 5.15.2 did not
      mention the CVEs until they were detailed in a release).

      Now create tarballs - 'git archive' does not work across submodule boundaries,
      so you need to create one archive from the top of qtwebengine/ and another
      from the top of src/3rdparty (chromium, gn, ninja are apparently all part of
      the qtwebengine-chromium module).  Then in a work area untar the qtwebengine
      tarball, go down to src/3rdparty and untar the submodule tarball.
      Decide on what to call the result and create a full xz tarball using tar -cJf.

      UPDATE: Since we have to host the tarball, and it is over 300MB, it makes
      sense to create a patch for subsequent fixes (for the first version, 314KB
      including the updates to the GIT-VERSIONS file).  For future updates, view
      the current updates patch to see the previous commits. When the new commits
      have been applied, rename the updated version to 'b', but untar the
      unpatched tarball as 'a' and then diff a to b in the usual manner to get
      all updates since the tarball was created.

      For our own releases, probably best to create a fresh tarball.

         end of note for editors -->

    <warning>
      <para>
        By default, ninja will use all online CPUs +2 (if at least 4 exist),
        even if they are not available to the current task because the build
        terminal has been restricted with 'taskset'.  In BLFS, this package 
        takes more time to build than than any other.  In one example,
        the build of this package crashed at about the 90 percent point 
        due to an out of memory problem on a system with 24 cores and 32 GB 
        of memory.

    <note>
      <para>
        Unusually, the shipped GN build system (used to create the Ninja files)
        requires a static <filename class="libraryfile">libstdc++.a</filename>
        although the installed libraries correctly use the shared version. If
        that static library is not present, the build will fail quite quickly.
        Please note that if you try to build webengine as part of
        <application>Qt</application> and the static library is not available,
        that build will either complete without installing webengine, or else
        fail during the install (both variants were observed in 5.12.0).

      <para>
        Unlike version 5.15.2, the chromium-derived build system now needs
        <command>python</command> to be available and to be python2. In
        BLFS-10.1 the creation of the python symlink was removed as a step
        towards eventually getting rid of python2 (other old packages which
        need python2 usually work by invoking python2). If you are still
        using an earlier version of BLFS where
        <filename>/usr/bin/python</filename> exists, you can skip the
        commands to create the symlink, and to later remove it.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      First, as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      user, create the python symlink:
    </para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>ln -svf /usr/bin/python{2,}</userinput></screen>

<!-- retain, there might later be a patch rather than a full 306MB tarball
    <para>
      Now apply a patch for security and other fixes:

<screen><userinput remap="pre">patch -Np1 -i ../qtwebengine-&qtwebengine-version;-upstream_fixes-2.patch</userinput></screen>-->

    <para>
      Apply apply a patch to fix several issues that can prevent the build working:
    </para>

<screen><userinput remap="pre">patch -Np1 -i ../qtwebengine-&qtwebengine-version;-build_fixes-1.patch</userinput></screen>

<!-- start of commands for git versions only -->
    <para>
      Although the patch has ensured that git is not invoked during the build,
      the build system has labyrinthine rules of byzantine complexity, and in
      particular trying to build without two <filename>.git</filename> directories
      will lead to it eventually falling into unexpected and unbuildable code
      which references a private header that has not been created. Avoid this
      by creating the required directories:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -pv .git src/3rdparty/chromium/.git</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Because this version of qtwebengine is aimed at a later release than the
      current public releases, change it to build for qt-&qt5-version; using a
      sed:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>sed -e '/^MODULE_VERSION/s/5.*/&qt5-version;/' -i .qmake.conf</userinput></screen>
<!-- end of commands for git versions only -->

    <para>
      Now, ensure that the local headers are available when not building as
      part of the complete <xref linkend="qt5"/>:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>find -type f -name "*.pr[io]" |
  xargs sed -i -e 's|INCLUDEPATH += |&amp;$$QTWEBENGINE_ROOT/include |'</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Next, allow the pulseaudio library to be linked at build time, instead
      of run time. This also prevents an issue with newer pulseaudio:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>sed -e '/link_pulseaudio/s/false/true/' \
    -i src/3rdparty/chromium/media/media_options.gni</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Finally, fix a change in the build system which allows its developers to
      pass e.g. -j20 to make (for quick tests of some areas) but breaks the
      build with LFS's use of the NINJAJOBS environment variable:
    </para>

      passed to qmake they must come after '--' which must follow '..' that points
      to the main directory. The options here cause it to use system ffmpeg and
      system icu.  If built as part of full Qt5, the system icu is automatically
      used (only) by Qt5Core if it is available, but unless this option is used
      webengine will always use its shipped copy of icu, adding time and space
      to the build.

      <option>-webengine-jumbo-build 0</option>: If this is added to the qmake
      command it will cause the 'Jumbo Build Merge Limit' to be reported as 'no'
      instead of 8. That turns off the jumbo build. Some distros do that to get
      a smaller build on some architectures such as MIPS. On x86_64 it might save
      a little space in the build, but the build time will increase by a very
      large amount.

        <application>falkon</application> they will be found in
        <filename class="directory">~/.cache/falkon/</filename>.
        You will need to do this if the browser starts to render
        the page and then changes to a blank tab with a message
        that something went wrong, and a button to Retry. Even
        after removing the old caches, you may need to retry a
        few times for each affected tab.

        If a browser using this package fails to run and when run
        from a term it reports 'Trace/breakpoint trap' that is
        probably a kernel configuration issue - there is no need
        to rebuild QtWebEngine, see the next section, recompile
        the kernel and reboot to the new kernel.

      enabled. In that case enable the following options in the kernel
